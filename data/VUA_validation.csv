cb5-fragment02,3186,"When she L_reached the L_plateau she L_remained L_standing , L_watching for L_Joss L_Barnet , L_waiting for the L_moment when she would L_see him L_riding towards her ."
cb5-fragment02,3187,There was no L_longer any L_need for her to be
cb5-fragment02,3188,‘ M_discovered ’ .
cb5-fragment02,3189,Her L_sole L_purpose in being there was to L_meet him and she was L_content that he should L_know it .
cb5-fragment02,3190,He was L_late this L_morning .
cb5-fragment02,3191,Or was she L_earlier than she L_thought ?
cb5-fragment02,3192,Had she M_misjudged the L_time ?
cb5-fragment02,3193,No L_matter .
cb5-fragment02,3194,"She was L_happy to L_wait for him , L_certain that L_soon she would L_see him L_riding towards her ."
cb5-fragment02,3195,"Then as the L_minutes M_passed and there was no M_sign of him , she M_considered that L_perhaps he had L_overslept ."
cb5-fragment02,3196,It could L_happen .
cb5-fragment02,3197,"Or had his L_horse L_gone L_lame , L_cast a L_shoe ?"
cb5-fragment02,3198,She L_sat down and L_prepared to L_wait as L_long as was L_necessary .
cb5-fragment02,3199,She L_knew that in the M_end he would L_come .
cb5-fragment02,3200,"After a few more L_minutes she L_became L_restless , and L_stood up again , her L_eyes M_searching the L_slope of the L_hillside and the L_valley below , M_trying to L_determine whether some M_small L_movement down there was a L_man on L_horseback or L_merely a M_trick of her L_imagination ."
cb5-fragment02,3201,Should she L_set off down the L_hill to L_meet him ?
cb5-fragment02,3202,But L_perhaps he would L_come by another L_route and then she would M_miss him .
cb5-fragment02,3203,"At the M_end of what she M_reckoned must be an L_hour , she M_faced the L_fact that he was not L_coming ."
cb5-fragment02,3204,"She L_dropped to the L_ground again and L_lay down , M_burying her L_face in the M_sweet-smelling L_grass ."
cb5-fragment02,3205,She had been L_mistaken L_ever to L_think that he would L_come .
cb5-fragment02,3206,"She had M_let her L_overwhelming L_desire M_feed her L_imagination ; had M_read L_something into his L_words , his L_looks , his L_actions , which had not been there at all ."
cb5-fragment02,3207,Her L_face M_burned with the L_shame of it .
cb5-fragment02,3208,"Such was the L_feeling L_Joss L_Barnet had M_aroused in her , that not for one L_moment did it L_occur to her to L_blame him for L_anything ."
cb5-fragment02,3209,It was all her M_fault .
cb5-fragment02,3210,"L_Sick at L_heart , she L_wept ."
cb5-fragment02,3211,Then she L_dried her L_eyes on the L_hem of her L_petticoat and L_went L_slowly M_back to the L_house .
cb5-fragment02,3212,‘ So you 've L_decided to M_put in an L_appearance ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3213,L_Cook L_said .
cb5-fragment02,3214,‘ I do L_seem to M_recall L_something about you L_offering to L_help me with the L_party L_preparations .
cb5-fragment02,3215,But of L_course if you 've M_changed your L_mind … ’
cb5-fragment02,3216,"‘ I have n't , ’ L_Ruth M_snapped ."
cb5-fragment02,3217,‘ I 'm L_ready to L_start now .
cb5-fragment02,3218,I do n't L_want any L_breakfast . ’
cb5-fragment02,3219,‘ L_Hoity-toity !
cb5-fragment02,3220,What 's the M_matter with L_everyone this L_morning ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3221,L_Cook L_demanded .
cb5-fragment02,3222,"‘ There 's L_Sean O'Farrell and the L_master L_left in a L_hurry this L_hour M_past for L_New L_York L_City , both without a L_bite inside them — and now you . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3223,‘ L_Gone to L_New L_York ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3224,‘ That 's what I L_said . ’
cb5-fragment02,3225,With L_Mrs L_Cranbrook 's L_words L_Ruth 's L_appetite L_immediately M_returned .
cb5-fragment02,3226,So he had not L_failed her after all !
cb5-fragment02,3227,How could she have L_thought that he would ?
cb5-fragment02,3228,"L_Something L_unforeseen and L_urgent had L_happened , since L_Sean had L_obviously L_known of it L_yesterday L_afternoon , and there had been no L_opportunity for him to L_inform her ."
cb5-fragment02,3229,L_Relief M_surged through her like a M_physical M_infusion of M_new M_blood .
cb5-fragment02,3230,"‘ I 've M_changed my L_mind , ’ she L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3231,‘ I would L_like some L_breakfast .
cb5-fragment02,3232,L_Suddenly I 'm L_hungry .
cb5-fragment02,3233,When will they be M_back ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3234,‘ L_Sean ?
cb5-fragment02,3235,How should I L_know ?
cb5-fragment02,3236,I do n't L_understand L_business .
cb5-fragment02,3237,"What I do L_understand is that if the L_master 's not L_home for the L_party L_tomorrow , the L_mistress wo n't be L_pleased — and that 's M_putting it M_mildly ."
cb5-fragment02,3238,"Do n't you L_dawdle over your L_breakfast then , not if you L_intend to M_make yourself M_useful ."
cb5-fragment02,3239,There 's L_plenty to be done . ’
cb5-fragment02,3240,L_Ruth L_worked all that L_day as though she had the L_strength of ten .
cb5-fragment02,3241,"They L_prepared L_chicken L_pies , the L_pastry as M_light as M_Ruth 's M_heart , L_turtle L_soup , a L_haunch of L_venison , L_jellies , L_blancmanges , L_syllabubs , L_trifles , and a M_host of other L_dishes , with L_still more to be done on the L_day of the L_party itself ."
cb5-fragment02,3242,L_Mrs L_Cranbrook L_unbent so M_far as to M_show L_approval .
cb5-fragment02,3243,"‘ You 've done very L_well , ’ she M_conceded ."
cb5-fragment02,3244,"L_Mrs L_Carson , L_knowing how L_much was L_involved , had L_excused L_Ruth from all other L_duties until L_Anna 's L_bedtime L_hour ."
cb5-fragment02,3245,And now it M_approached .
cb5-fragment02,3246,She L_took off the L_voluminous L_apron L_Cook had L_lent her and L_went in L_search of her M_charge .
cb5-fragment02,3247,L_Anna was in L_tears .
cb5-fragment02,3248,"‘ We 're L_going L_home , ’ she L_sobbed ."
cb5-fragment02,3249,‘ I do n't L_want to L_go L_back to L_Mrs L_Gutermann 's .
cb5-fragment02,3250,I L_want to L_stay with L_Edward .
cb5-fragment02,3251,I L_want to L_live with him for L_ever and L_ever ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3252,"L_Ruth could L_think of few L_worse L_fates , but her L_stomach M_lurched at the L_thought of L_leaving L_Millfield ."
cb5-fragment02,3253,‘ How do you L_know we 're L_leaving ? ’ she L_asked .
cb5-fragment02,3254,‘ Who L_told you ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3255,"‘ L_Miss L_Fitch , ’ L_Anna L_wailed ."
cb5-fragment02,3256,‘ I do n't L_like L_Miss L_Fitch .
cb5-fragment02,3257,I L_hate her !
cb5-fragment02,3258,I L_daresay she L_wants me to L_go ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3259,"‘ L_Perhaps she 's L_mistaken , ’ L_Ruth L_said , though she L_doubted if L_Miss L_Fitch was L_ever L_wrong ."
cb5-fragment02,3260,‘ We 'll L_ask your L_mama the L_moment she L_comes in . ’
cb5-fragment02,3261,"‘ I 'm L_afraid it 's L_true , ’ L_Mrs L_Carson L_told them ."
cb5-fragment02,3262,‘ Of L_course we were only L_invited for ten L_days or so . ’
cb5-fragment02,3263,L_Ruth had M_lost L_count of L_time .
cb5-fragment02,3264,"To her , the M_long L_summer L_days had M_stretched M_ahead , M_world without M_end ."
cb5-fragment02,3265,"‘ We are L_going to L_leave on L_Sunday , ’ L_Mrs L_Carson M_went on ."
cb5-fragment02,3266,"‘ Not too L_early in the L_day , since I L_daresay we shall all be L_tired after L_tomorrow 's L_party . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3267,"‘ L_Anna L_tells me she L_never L_wants to L_leave L_Edward , ’ L_Ruth L_said after the L_child had M_gone to L_sleep ."
cb5-fragment02,3268,L_Mrs L_Carson L_smiled L_indulgently .
cb5-fragment02,3269,‘ L_Dearest L_Anna !
cb5-fragment02,3270,"She 's a L_little L_young for a L_holiday L_infatuation , but we all have them L_sooner or L_later ."
cb5-fragment02,3271,L_Thank L_goodness they L_never M_last !
cb5-fragment02,3272,"And the more M_intense they are , the M_shorter the L_duration , so L_Anna should L_soon be over it . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3273,‘ Will L_Mr L_Barnet be M_back for the L_party ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3274,L_Ruth L_asked .
cb5-fragment02,3275,"‘ I L_expect you L_mean will O'Farrell be M_back , ’ L_Mrs L_Carson L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3276,"‘ And the L_answer is , I do n't L_know ."
cb5-fragment02,3277,L_Mrs L_Barnet L_tells me that she L_expects her L_husband when she L_sees him .
cb5-fragment02,3278,It 's a L_fact that L_American L_men L_seem to M_put L_business before L_everything .
cb5-fragment02,3279,L_Thank L_goodness L_Englishmen are not like that ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3280,"M_Next L_morning L_Ruth was down in the L_kitchen L_early , L_eagerly L_hoping to L_find L_Sean there ."
cb5-fragment02,3281,"He could L_well have L_returned L_late at L_night and she not L_heard him , though she had L_stayed L_awake for a M_long L_time , L_listening for the L_sound of the L_horses , the L_carriage L_wheels on the L_drive ."
cb5-fragment02,3282,There was no M_sign of L_Sean but L_Mrs L_Cranbrook was L_already at L_work .
cb5-fragment02,3283,"‘ I L_hope you 're L_ready to L_help me , ’ she L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3284,‘ L_Everybody is L_busy with this and that — as if L_food was n't the most L_important M_thing ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3285,"‘ I 'll L_help , L_Mrs L_Cranbrook , ’ L_Ruth L_agreed ."
cb5-fragment02,3286,‘ They 're not M_back then ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3287,She L_tried to L_sound L_nonchalant .
cb5-fragment02,3288,‘ Not M_back ?
cb5-fragment02,3289,"Oh , you L_mean O'Farrell and the L_master ?"
cb5-fragment02,3290,Not that I L_know of .
cb5-fragment02,3291,There 's no L_telling when they ‘ U L_return .
cb5-fragment02,3292,L_Sometimes they 're L_gone for three or four L_days at a L_time . ’
cb5-fragment02,3293,‘ But L_surely … with the L_party ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3294,L_Mrs L_Cranbrook L_shrugged .
cb5-fragment02,3295,"‘ He 's a M_law M_unto himself , the L_master ."
cb5-fragment02,3296,Not for the L_likes of you and me to L_question why . ’
cb5-fragment02,3297,The M_heart had L_gone out of the L_day .
cb5-fragment02,3298,"L_Ruth L_fetched and L_carried and L_stirred and L_whipped , L_praying every L_moment that L_Joss L_Barnet would L_return before they L_left L_Millfield M_next L_day ."
cb5-fragment02,3299,"But when the L_day had M_dragged to L_evening — in L_spite of all there was to do the L_time now M_passed M_slowly — and L_still there was no M_sign of the two L_men , she L_began to M_lose L_hope ."
cb5-fragment02,3300,"In the L_evening , L_bone-tired , she L_left the L_kitchen and L_went to L_put a L_reluctant L_Anna to L_bed ."
cb5-fragment02,3301,Then she M_turned to L_helping L_Mrs L_Carson .
cb5-fragment02,3302,"She L_brushed her L_mistress 's L_hair and L_piled it on L_top of her L_head in a M_cluster of L_curls , L_carefully and L_meticulously L_arranged to L_look L_quite L_casual ."
cb5-fragment02,3303,It was a L_style L_Ruth had L_devised herself and L_Mrs L_Carson was L_delighted with the L_result .
cb5-fragment02,3304,"‘ It L_looks so L_different , ’ she L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3305,"‘ You L_really are L_quite L_clever at this , L_Ruth ."
cb5-fragment02,3306,And now for my L_dress . ’
cb5-fragment02,3307,"She L_looked L_beautiful in the L_yellow L_satin , the L_low-cut L_bodice L_tight against her L_slight L_figure , the L_skirt L_billowing out ."
cb5-fragment02,3308,But L_Ruth had no M_heart either to L_appreciate or to L_envy her L_mistress .
cb5-fragment02,3309,Her M_spirits were at their M_lowest M_ebb .
cb5-fragment02,3310,"L_Mrs L_Carson M_gave her L_maid a M_sharp , M_compassionate L_look ."
cb5-fragment02,3311,She L_thought she L_knew the L_cause of this L_mood and in a M_way she was L_glad to L_see it .
cb5-fragment02,3312,At L_least it M_showed that the L_girl 's L_mind was M_working in the L_right M_direction .
cb5-fragment02,3313,"‘ Do n't L_worry , L_Ruth , ’ she L_said L_kindly ."
cb5-fragment02,3314,‘ I L_dare L_say O'Farrell will be M_back L_tomorrow before we L_leave .
cb5-fragment02,3315,"And if not , there is L_always L_New L_York when the L_Barnets L_return in the M_fall ."
cb5-fragment02,3316,"And now I L_sha n't L_need you again this L_evening , so L_apart from L_looking in on L_Anna from L_time to L_time , you may do just as you L_please . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3317,Had she not been so L_downhearted L_Ruth would have L_enjoyed herself .
cb5-fragment02,3318,But she had L_given up all L_hope of L_Joss L_Barnet L_returning that L_evening and L_nothing L_else in the L_world L_mattered .
cb5-fragment02,3319,The L_party M_scene was L_pretty L_enough .
cb5-fragment02,3320,L_Coloured L_lanterns L_hung in the L_trees which L_fringed the L_lawn and L_bordered the L_lake beyond .
cb5-fragment02,3321,"L_Torchlights , M_flaring against the L_night L_sky and L_reflected in the L_water , had been L_set up wherever it was L_suitable ."
cb5-fragment02,3322,L_Already the L_orchestra had L_begun to L_play and the L_elegantly L_dressed to L_appear .
cb5-fragment02,3323,L_Ruth had no M_heart for it .
cb5-fragment02,3324,"She L_climbed the L_stairs to her L_room , then L_undressed and L_went to L_bed , L_wetting the L_pillow with her L_tears which , L_held L_back all L_day , now L_flowed L_unchecked ."
cb5-fragment02,3325,"Her only L_comfort was not to have L_Miss L_Beard in her L_room , to be L_able to L_suffer in L_solitude ."
cb5-fragment02,3326,"Though she L_thought L_sleep would L_never M_come , L_eventually it did ."
cb5-fragment02,3327,She M_fell L_asleep to the L_sound of L_music M_drifting L_upwards from the L_drawing-room .
cb5-fragment02,3328,"When she L_wakened it was L_still L_dark , the L_orchestra L_still L_playing , though it was not that which had L_aroused her ."
cb5-fragment02,3329,"M_Penetrating her L_sleep she had L_heard the M_faint L_click of the L_door L_latch , and then the L_familiar L_squeak of the L_hinge as the L_door to her L_room L_slowly L_opened ."
cb5-fragment02,3330,"She L_raised herself on one L_elbow , L_blinking her L_eyes , L_trying to L_see in the L_darkness ."
cb5-fragment02,3331,But L_enough L_light M_came from the L_landing on to which the L_door L_opened to L_silhouette the L_man L_standing there .
cb5-fragment02,3332,It was L_Joss L_Barnet .
cb5-fragment02,3333,"M_Shock M_made her L_cry out , and he L_closed the L_door and L_moved towards her in L_quick L_strides , L_putting his L_hand across her L_mouth to L_stop-her L_scream ."
cb5-fragment02,3334,"Then he L_sat on her L_bed and , without a L_word from either of them , she L_went L_willingly into his L_arms and was L_held L_close in his L_embrace ."
cb5-fragment02,3335,She L_felt his L_heart M_beating M_strong and L_fast against hers .
cb5-fragment02,3336,"They L_stayed like that for a M_long L_moment and then he L_said , ‘ L_Light the L_candle . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3337,"‘ I ca n't , ’ she L_whispered ."
cb5-fragment02,3338,‘ L_Someone will L_see the L_light under the L_door . ’
cb5-fragment02,3339,"‘ No L_matter if they do , ’ he L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3340,‘ They will not L_think of me here .
cb5-fragment02,3341,Only my L_coachman L_knows I am L_home .
cb5-fragment02,3342,I have not L_yet M_joined the L_party . ’
cb5-fragment02,3343,‘ You L_came to me L_first ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3344,She could L_hardly L_believe it .
cb5-fragment02,3345,"He would not L_tell her , this L_funny M_bewitching L_little L_English L_girl , that he had L_come to her L_first because he could not L_keep L_away from her ."
cb5-fragment02,3346,"She had been on his L_mind since the L_morning he had L_seen her from his L_horse ; L_frightened L_yet L_defiant , M_sparking with L_anger ."
cb5-fragment02,3347,"L_Almost , but not L_quite , she had L_come between him and the L_work he had had to do in L_New L_York L_City ."
cb5-fragment02,3348,The L_moment the L_work was done he had M_ordered his L_coachman to L_drive him M_back to L_Millfield as L_fast as the L_horses would L_go .
cb5-fragment02,3349,"‘ L_Light the L_candle , ’ he L_repeated ."
cb5-fragment02,3350,L_Ruth 's L_fingers M_trembled as she L_obeyed him .
cb5-fragment02,3351,Then she L_lay L_back on her L_pillow and they L_looked at each other as if it was for the L_first L_time .
cb5-fragment02,3352,"He L_traced the L_contours of her L_face with M_gentle L_fingers , L_outlining the L_curve of her L_mouth , L_stroking her L_temples ."
cb5-fragment02,3353,"Without any L_hurry , in L_spite of the L_impatience which had M_brought him here , he L_caressed the L_length of her L_neck and the M_slope of her L_shoulders ."
cb5-fragment02,3354,"From out of L_nowhere , L_Ruth L_remembered L_Dick L_Parker : but not , this L_time , the L_pleasure of her M_union with him , only the M_pain it had M_brought her on the L_Christmas L_Eve M_following ."
cb5-fragment02,3355,"And now although her L_whole L_body M_cried out for L_fulfilment and she L_longed for L_Joss L_Barnet to L_complete what he had L_surely L_come to do , she L_knew that she must not L_let it L_happen ."
cb5-fragment02,3356,"She L_turned her L_face L_away from him , L_pushed his L_hand from her ."
cb5-fragment02,3357,‘ No ! ’ she L_cried .
cb5-fragment02,3358,‘ You must not ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3359,"He M_gave not the M_slightest M_sign of having L_heard her , L_continuing to L_stroke her L_neck , and now L_inserting his L_fingers under the L_neckline of her L_nightshift ."
cb5-fragment02,3360,She L_tried again to L_push him L_away .
cb5-fragment02,3361,‘ Please !
cb5-fragment02,3362,L_Please do n't ! ’ she L_cried .
cb5-fragment02,3363,It was L_surprise which M_made him L_stop for a L_second .
cb5-fragment02,3364,"He L_smiled at her , an L_unexpectedly M_tender L_smile ."
cb5-fragment02,3365,"‘ I wo n't L_hurt you , ’ he L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3366,‘ Do n't be L_afraid . ’
cb5-fragment02,3367,‘ I 'm not L_afraid of being L_hurt . ’
cb5-fragment02,3368,‘ Then what … ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3369,"‘ I 'm L_afraid of L_afterwards , ’ she L_said L_hesitantly ."
cb5-fragment02,3370,‘ If I were to have a L_child .
cb5-fragment02,3371,It would be the M_end of the M_world for me . ’
cb5-fragment02,3372,"‘ But you wo n't , ’ he L_assured her ."
cb5-fragment02,3373,‘ I 'll M_see to that .
cb5-fragment02,3374,I 'm not L_totally L_callous . ’
cb5-fragment02,3375,‘ You L_promise ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3376,‘ I L_promise . ’
cb5-fragment02,3377,"She L_lay L_quiescent and L_felt his L_strong L_fingers , L_quicker now , M_move to L_unfasten the L_buttons of her L_shift one by one ."
cb5-fragment02,3378,"And when he had L_undone her L_gown , and had L_difficulty in L_lifting it over her L_head , she L_raised herself from the L_pillow and L_helped him to L_take it off ."
cb5-fragment02,3379,"Then he L_pulled down the L_sheet , which was all the L_bedclothes she had L_needed on that L_warm L_night , and she L_lay L_naked before him ."
cb5-fragment02,3380,She L_observed him without L_shame as he L_looked at every L_part of her .
cb5-fragment02,3381,"Her L_pleasure was in him , and in his L_delight of her ."
cb5-fragment02,3382,"When , at L_last , he M_stripped off his L_clothes and L_came into her , it was as if this was the L_moment to which all her L_life had been M_leading ."
cb5-fragment02,3383,"He was a L_skilful L_lover : L_tender and L_gentle in the L_beginning , then L_powerful , L_persistent , M_rough L_almost — until , his L_passion M_rising in M_harmony with hers , the M_climax M_came like the M_bursting of a thousand M_stars , like the M_beginning and M_ending of the M_world ."
cb5-fragment02,3384,"L_Afterwards they L_lay L_quietly L_side by L_side , not L_speaking , until he L_said , ‘ I must L_go . ’"
cb5-fragment02,3385,"‘ Not L_yet , ’ she L_begged ."
cb5-fragment02,3386,‘ You ca n't L_leave me L_yet . ’
cb5-fragment02,3387,"She L_turned over and L_lay on L_top of him , L_trying to L_pin him down with her own L_slight L_weight , and he L_began to L_fondle her and she him , and L_almost at once they were M_making L_love again ."
cb5-fragment02,3388,"‘ You are a M_sorceress , ’ he L_told her when it was all over ."
cb5-fragment02,3389,‘ An M_enchantress .
cb5-fragment02,3390,L_Women as L_tempting as you should be L_kept out of the L_sight of L_mortal L_men . ’
cb5-fragment02,3391,"‘ You 're not a L_mortal L_man , ’ L_Ruth L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3392,‘ You 're a M_god ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3393,He L_laughed out L_loud .
cb5-fragment02,3394,‘ L_Hush ! ’ she L_cautioned .
cb5-fragment02,3395,‘ L_Someone will L_hear you . ’
cb5-fragment02,3396,"‘ I 'm a L_real L_man all L_right , ’ he L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3397,‘ As I 've just L_proved to you .
cb5-fragment02,3398,And would again if L_time M_allowed . ’
cb5-fragment02,3399,Then he L_stood up and L_quickly L_began to L_dress .
cb5-fragment02,3400,‘ I must L_go and do my L_duty as a L_host for what 's M_left of the L_night . ’
cb5-fragment02,3401,"‘ Do n't L_leave me , ’ she L_begged ."
cb5-fragment02,3402,‘ Please L_stay ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3403,"He L_looked at her in L_surprise , L_spoke L_brusquely ."
cb5-fragment02,3404,‘ But of L_course I must L_go .
cb5-fragment02,3405,There 's no L_question . ’
cb5-fragment02,3406,M_Long L_afterwards L_Ruth L_realised that this was the L_moment when she had L_learned that she could L_never M_come L_first with him .
cb5-fragment02,3407,"L_However L_much he might L_desire her , she would have no more than the L_allotted M_space in his L_life ."
cb5-fragment02,3408,‘ When am I L_going to L_see you again ? ’ she L_asked .
cb5-fragment02,3409,"That , L_also , was the L_wrong M_thing to L_say ."
cb5-fragment02,3410,"‘ I ca n't M_make M_plans , ’ he L_said L_sharply ."
cb5-fragment02,3411,‘ But we L_leave L_tomorrow ! ’ she L_exclaimed .
cb5-fragment02,3412,That M_took him by L_surprise .
cb5-fragment02,3413,‘ The M_deuce you do !
cb5-fragment02,3414,L_Well I shall M_see to that .
cb5-fragment02,3415,My L_wife will M_extend the L_invitation to the L_Carsons .
cb5-fragment02,3416,I M_take it they 're not L_promised L_elsewhere ? ’
cb5-fragment02,3417,"‘ Oh no , ’ L_Ruth L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3418,‘ We 're L_going L_back to L_New L_York L_City . ’
cb5-fragment02,3419,"He L_finished L_dressing , then L_came and L_held her by the L_shoulders , L_kissing her L_lightly on the L_mouth ."
cb5-fragment02,3420,As he was L_leaving he L_turned L_around and L_threw a L_small L_box on to the L_bed .
cb5-fragment02,3421,"‘ From the L_city , ’ he L_said ."
cb5-fragment02,3422,‘ You L_see that I had you in my L_mind ! ’
cb5-fragment02,3423,"He was out of the L_room before she could L_open the L_box , a M_dark L_blue L_leather M_affair , L_lined with L_white L_velvet , against which L_lay a L_fine L_gold L_chain with a L_small L_oval L_locket L_set around the L_edge with L_seed L_pearls ."
cb5-fragment02,3424,She L_gasped in L_amazement .
cb5-fragment02,3425,"It was without L_doubt the most L_beautiful L_thing she had L_ever owned , or L_ever would ."
cb5-fragment02,3426,"Such L_delicacy , such M_refinement !"
cb5-fragment02,3427,"Her L_fingers M_trembling with L_excitement , she L_fastened it around her L_neck ."
cb5-fragment02,3428,It should L_remain there for L_ever .
cb5-fragment02,3429,She would L_never L_take it off .
ccw-fragment03,1561,L_Ellen and I L_lingered on in L_Mama L_Sipcott 's for another L_hour and a M_half ; L_indulging in the L_sailor 's L_shorebound L_pastime of M_planning the L_perfect L_voyage .
ccw-fragment03,1562,"We L_decided that L_Masquerade would L_sail from the L_Bahamas to L_Panama , and L_thence to the L_Galapagos where we would L_find L_Darwin 's L_giant L_tortoises ."
ccw-fragment03,1563,Then we would L_sail L_south to L_Easter L_Island to L_explore the L_mysterious L_statues before L_going to the L_mutineers ' L_refuge on L_Pitcairn L_Island .
ccw-fragment03,1564,"After that we would L_go to L_Tahiti , and I L_saw the L_excitement M_grow in L_Ellen as she L_realised that these M_plans were so M_close to M_coming L_true ."
ccw-fragment03,1565,"It was an L_excitement that M_matched my own , for I had L_never L_sailed the L_South L_Seas and I had L_long M_dreamed of that M_scatter of L_tiny , M_magically L_named L_islands M_strewn across one L_third of a L_globe ."
ccw-fragment03,1566,By the L_time we had L_drunk our L_third L_bottle of L_wine L_Ellen and I had L_long M_reached L_New L_Zealand and were L_already L_sailing L_north towards L_New L_Caledonia .
ccw-fragment03,1567,We were L_happy .
ccw-fragment03,1568,We M_caught the L_bus M_back to L_Ellen 's L_apartment and L_collected her L_clothes and L_notebooks .
ccw-fragment03,1569,She was L_moving M_back on L_board L_Wavebreaker in L_preparation for the M_next L_day 's L_early L_departure .
ccw-fragment03,1570,"I L_carried her L_luggage to the L_yard , M_noting that L_even L_Ellen 's M_strident L_feminism M_evaporated in the M_face of two L_heavy L_bags and L_tropical L_heat ."
ccw-fragment03,1571,"Once in the L_boatyard L_Ellen L_ran L_ahead of me , L_evidently L_eager to L_reach L_Wavebreaker 's L_air L_conditioning ."
ccw-fragment03,1572,"Then , as she L_reached the L_dock 's L_edge , she L_suddenly L_checked ."
ccw-fragment03,1573,‘ What on L_earth is that ?
ccw-fragment03,1574,"Oh , no ! ’"
ccw-fragment03,1575,She L_began to L_run again .
ccw-fragment03,1576,When I L_reached the L_water 's L_edge I L_understood her L_dismay .
ccw-fragment03,1577,"A L_large L_sports-fishing L_boat was L_moored alongside L_Wavebreaker , but L_moored so M_crudely that whoever had L_brought the L_powerboat alongside the L_schooner had not L_bothered to L_put out L_fenders , but L_instead had L_gouged L_long L_ugly L_gashes in L_Wavebreaker 's L_white L_paint ."
ccw-fragment03,1578,L_Yet L_even the L_gashes were not so L_ugly as the L_expensive L_boat that had L_caused them .
ccw-fragment03,1579,"There was L_nothing L_wrong with the L_boat 's L_lines , which were M_sleekly L_functional , but her L_long M_powerful L_hull , her L_upperworks , and L_even the L_interior of her L_capacious L_working L_deck had all been L_painted with a wartime dazzle L_paint ."
ccw-fragment03,1580,"The L_seemingly L_random and L_jagged-edged L_pattern of L_blue , L_black , L_silver , L_green and L_white had been L_designed to M_disguise a L_boat 's L_shape from the M_prying L_eyes of L_U-Boat L_captains , so it L_seemed L_somewhat L_fanciful to L_thus L_camouflage a L_pleasure L_boat in the L_Bahamas ."
ccw-fragment03,1581,"This L_boat was M_called L_Dream M_Baby , and she was L_clearly an L_expensive M_infant for L_rods and M_whip-aerials and L_outriggers M_splayed from her L_upperworks like the M_antennae of some M_outlandish M_insect ."
ccw-fragment03,1582,"She M_boasted a L_harpoon L_walkway , a flybridge , and , above the L_highest L_wheel-platform , an L_aluminium M_canopy which M_held a L_radar L_aerial ."
ccw-fragment03,1583,"The L_fighting L_chair on her L_aft L_deck had L_thick L_white L_leather L_straps M_giving it the L_appearance of a M_padded M_electric M_chair , while the L_dazzle L_paint M_gave the L_boat an L_oddly L_military L_look that was L_completed by the L_number 666 that was L_painted on her M_bows in L_silver-edged L_black L_numerals like those L_warships M_use to L_display their L_commissioning L_numbers ."
ccw-fragment03,1584,The L_boat 's M_wrap-around L_windscreens were L_made of L_black L_polarised L_glass which only M_added to L_Dream L_Baby 's M_ugly M_air of L_menace .
ccw-fragment03,1585,"L_Ellen , L_unencumbered with L_luggage , had L_already L_reached L_Wavebreaker and L_taken two L_plastic L_fenders from a L_locker ."
ccw-fragment03,1586,She L_swung L_lithely down to L_Dream L_Baby 's L_gaudily L_painted L_deck and L_cushioned the two L_hulls .
ccw-fragment03,1587,‘ How L_bad is the L_damage ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1588,I L_called down to her when I L_reached L_Wavebreaker .
ccw-fragment03,1589,‘ It 's L_scraped M_back to M_bare L_metal ! ’
ccw-fragment03,1590,‘ I 'll M_give it some L_paint . ’
ccw-fragment03,1591,"L_Wavebreaker 's L_hull was L_made of L_steel and , while such L_hulls are L_marvellously M_strong and L_safe , they are L_soon M_weakened if their L_steel is L_exposed to L_salt L_air ."
ccw-fragment03,1592,I had to L_paint the L_gashes as L_soon as L_possible so that L_rust would not L_begin to M_bite into L_Wavebreaker 's L_long M_sleekness .
ccw-fragment03,1593,L_Ellen L_looked around the L_oddly L_painted L_powerboat .
ccw-fragment03,1594,‘ You 'd L_think L_someone L_rich L_enough to own a L_rig like this could L_afford a L_pair of L_fenders . ’
ccw-fragment03,1595,‘ Who L_cares ?
ccw-fragment03,1596,"Just L_cut the L_damn L_boat L_loose , ’ I L_said L_vengefully ."
ccw-fragment03,1597,"L_Ellen L_ignored my L_advice while I , L_obedient to the M_rule that if a L_job L_needed doing then do it without L_delay , L_found a L_pot of L_white L_paint and M_dug through the L_locker for a L_clean L_brush ."
ccw-fragment03,1598,"Then , from behind me , an L_unfamiliar L_voice L_sounded : ‘ Oh , M_ring my M_bells . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1599,It was a L_man 's L_voice ; L_drawling and M_lazy .
ccw-fragment03,1600,"I L_twisted L_around and L_almost L_blinded myself by L_staring L_straight into the L_sun , but then , through the L_dizzying L_glare , I L_made out the L_long L_silhouette of a L_tall L_man who L_seemed , L_incongruously , to be L_dressed in a L_long , L_transparent L_dressing L_gown ."
ccw-fragment03,1601,"He was L_emerging in L_stately L_fashion from L_Wavebreaker 's companionway and , though I could L_see he was L_tall and L_lanky and had a L_ponytail of L_hair , I could L_make out no L_details of his L_face ."
ccw-fragment03,1602,‘ Who the M_hell are you ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1603,I L_demanded .
ccw-fragment03,1604,"The L_man L_ignored me , L_walking L_instead towards L_Ellen who , L_dressed only in L_shorts and L_T-shirt , was L_climbing L_long-legged over L_Wavebreaker 's L_rail ."
ccw-fragment03,1605,"‘ Be M_still my M_restless L_heart , ’ the L_man had a M_strong , M_caressing L_voice and the M_slow M_luscious L_accent of L_America 's M_deep L_south ."
ccw-fragment03,1606,"‘ L_Dear L_lady , L_dear L_lady , to L_think that I might have L_lived my M_whole L_life through and L_never L_seen you ."
ccw-fragment03,1607,"Oh , L_lay me down , just L_lay me down . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1608,"L_Ellen , L_usually so L_quick with a L_scornful L_reply , just L_stood and L_stared at the L_elegant L_stranger who L_stopped one L_pace L_away from her , L_took her L_hand , then L_bowed above her L_fingers ."
ccw-fragment03,1609,"He L_kissed the L_air a L_fastidiously L_polite L_inch above her L_knuckles , then L_closed his L_eyes ."
ccw-fragment03,1610,"‘ L_Dear L_sweet M_Lord above , I do L_thank L_Thee for L_Thy L_kindness in L_showing me this L_lovely L_woman before I L_died . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1611,To my L_astonishment and L_chagrin L_Ellen L_left her L_hand in his as he L_opened his L_eyes and L_smiled at her .
ccw-fragment03,1612,"‘ My L_name , ’ he M_stroked her with his L_voice , ‘ is L_Jesse L_Isambard L_Sweetman ."
ccw-fragment03,1613,"And who , L_dear L_creature , are you ? ’"
ccw-fragment03,1614,L_Ellen L_still L_said L_nothing .
ccw-fragment03,1615,"I had L_straightened up and L_moved L_aside so that the L_sun no L_longer L_dazzled me and I could L_see L_Sweetman L_properly , and what I L_saw I did not L_like ."
ccw-fragment03,1616,"His L_face was M_old and M_young , L_sardonic and L_knowing , M_amused and L_handsome ; the L_face of a L_man who has L_seen the L_world 's M_wickedness and L_knows how to M_match it with his own ."
ccw-fragment03,1617,"His L_long L_black L_hair was L_tied into its L_ponytail with a L_velvet L_ribbon , his L_skin was M_parchment L_pale , and his L_eyes M_dark ."
ccw-fragment03,1618,"I M_put his L_age at forty , but L_even among L_men twenty L_years L_younger he would have been L_accounted L_handsome , and he L_knew it , for his L_expression M_showed both L_confidence and L_amusement as he L_continued to L_hold L_Ellen 's L_hand , and he M_showed L_even more L_amusement when she L_suddenly L_realised just what M_liberty she was L_thus L_granting him and L_jerked her L_fingers L_swiftly L_away ."
ccw-fragment03,1619,"L_Thus L_released , L_Jesse L_Sweetman L_turned to L_look at me ."
ccw-fragment03,1620,"The L_dressing L_gown had L_proved to be a L_long , L_stylish , L_ankle-length L_duster L_coat which was L_loosely L_woven from a L_delicate L_white L_cotton ."
ccw-fragment03,1621,Beneath the L_filmy L_topcoat he L_wore a L_black L_shirt and L_black L_trousers that were L_tucked into L_tall L_black L_boots .
ccw-fragment03,1622,"It was a M_dramatic and L_impractical L_outfit of a L_kind I only L_expected to L_see on the L_male M_models who L_posed in the more L_outlandish L_fashion L_magazines that our L_rich L_clients L_brought aboard L_Wavebreaker , L_yet L_Jesse L_Isambard L_Sweetman L_managed to L_wear the L_elaborate L_style with an M_elegant L_insouciance ."
ccw-fragment03,1623,"The only L_incongruous M_note was a L_cheap L_round L_badge , L_enamelled in L_red and L_yellow , that he L_wore on his L_shirt , which M_bore the L_legend ‘ Just L_Say No ! ’ ."
ccw-fragment03,1624,"‘ You must be L_Nicholas L_Breakspear , ’ he L_said L_carelessly , as though he did not L_much L_care whether I was or not ."
ccw-fragment03,1625,‘ Is that L_gaudy L_piece of L_junk your L_boat ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1626,I L_gestured to where L_Dream L_Baby 's L_aerials L_showed above L_Wavebreaker 's L_gunwale .
ccw-fragment03,1627,L_Sweetman L_turned and L_pretended to L_notice the L_sports-fishing L_boat for the L_first L_time .
ccw-fragment03,1628,"‘ No , ’ he L_said L_helpfully , then M_bestowed a L_patronising L_smile on me ."
ccw-fragment03,1629,‘ You L_look so like your L_father .
ccw-fragment03,1630,It 's L_really L_uncanny . ’
ccw-fragment03,1631,‘ Did you L_bring that L_boat here ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1632,I L_persevered .
ccw-fragment03,1633,"‘ Oh , L_indeed I did , ’ he L_said M_brightly , as though he L_merely L_indulged a L_rather M_dim L_child 's L_curiosity ."
ccw-fragment03,1634,"‘ Your L_mother was L_Malise L_Fielding , am I L_right ?"
ccw-fragment03,1635,Or are you L_Lucy de L_Sills ’ L_son ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1636,‘ Why the M_hell did n't you L_use L_fenders when you L_tied alongside ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1637,"He L_sighed , L_intimating what a L_bore I was being ."
ccw-fragment03,1638,"‘ I did not L_use L_fenders , L_Breakspear , because I L_despise L_precautions ."
ccw-fragment03,1639,L_Precautions are the M_symptoms of M_small and M_fearful L_minds .
ccw-fragment03,1640,"L_Precautions will not M_conquer L_empires , they will not M_build L_great L_cities , they will not M_transmute L_dreams into L_gold or M_carry L_men across L_wide L_oceans , and L_precautions will not , L_emphatically not , M_win L_fair L_ladies , ’ and here he L_turned to L_Ellen and L_lasciviously M_dropped his L_gaze to her L_long L_bare L_legs ."
ccw-fragment03,1641,"L_Ellen L_twisted L_away and L_Sweetman L_laughed at her L_obvious L_discomfiture , then , as L_coolly as though he owned L_Wavebreaker , he L_stepped down into the L_central L_cockpit where he L_first M_brushed at , then L_sat on , one of the L_white L_cushioned L_seats by the L_ship 's L_wheel ."
ccw-fragment03,1642,"‘ I 've had a L_look L_round the L_boat , ’ he L_said very L_coolly , ‘ and I L_approve of her ."
ccw-fragment03,1643,So L_tell me the L_cost of a L_week 's L_charter . ’
ccw-fragment03,1644,"‘ The L_man you L_want to L_see , ’ I L_said , ‘ is L_called L_Matthew L_McIllvanney and his L_office is the L_pink L_building with the L_outside L_staircase ."
ccw-fragment03,1645,"He 's not here this L_afternoon , but you can L_doubtless L_telephone him M_next L_week . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1646,L_Sweetman L_took a L_pair of L_polarised L_sunglasses from his L_shirt L_pocket and L_put them on before L_inspecting me again .
ccw-fragment03,1647,He did not L_seem to L_like what he L_saw .
ccw-fragment03,1648,"‘ You 're L_really not being L_noticeably L_helpful , ’ he L_said after a L_pause , ‘ so L_let us L_try again shall we ?"
ccw-fragment03,1649,Would you L_please L_tell me the M_high L_season L_price for one L_week ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1650,‘ How L_many L_passengers ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1651,L_Ellen L_asked before I could L_refuse to L_answer .
ccw-fragment03,1652,"L_Sweetman L_paused again , this L_time to L_light a L_long M_pale L_blue L_cigarette with a M_slim L_gold L_lighter ."
ccw-fragment03,1653,He L_shrugged .
ccw-fragment03,1654,"‘ Two , four , six L_passengers ?"
ccw-fragment03,1655,Does it L_really L_matter ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1656,"‘ One L_week in M_high L_season L_costs ten thousand L_US L_dollars for two L_people , and every L_extra L_couple is another thousand L_bucks . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1657,"L_Ellen 's L_voice was M_cold , as though she L_disliked L_satisfying his L_curiosity ."
ccw-fragment03,1658,‘ And to those L_prices you have to M_add the L_boat 's L_running L_costs . ’
ccw-fragment03,1659,‘ Which are ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1660,L_Sweetman L_asked L_carelessly .
ccw-fragment03,1661,‘ A M_lot . ’
ccw-fragment03,1662,L_Ellen L_said L_flatly .
ccw-fragment03,1663,"‘ You 're L_talking L_fuel , L_food and L_liquor , plus any L_toys you might L_want L_aboard like L_scuba L_equipment , L_snorkels , L_jet-skis or L_sailboards . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1664,"L_Sweetman M_drew on his L_fancy L_cigarette , then L_blew a M_plume of L_smoke into L_Wavebreaker 's L_rigging before L_smiling L_lazily at L_Ellen ."
ccw-fragment03,1665,"‘ And L_tell me , M_sweet L_creature , do you M_count as a M_toy ?"
ccw-fragment03,1666,Or are you a M_part of the L_initial ten thousand L_dollars ? ’
ccw-fragment03,1667,"‘ L_Get off the L_boat , ’ I L_said ."
ccw-fragment03,1668,‘ L_Shut up . ’
ccw-fragment03,1669,He M_turned on me like a M_snake .
ccw-fragment03,1670,"‘ You 're L_nothing but a L_hired L_hand , L_Breakspear , so L_shut the L_fuck up . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1671,He L_glanced at the L_paint L_pot and L_brush that I was L_still L_holding .
ccw-fragment03,1672,‘ L_Go and L_paint L_something .
ccw-fragment03,1673,Be L_useful . ’
ccw-fragment03,1674,"He L_stared into my L_eyes , L_challenging me to L_defy him , and when I did not L_move he L_looked M_back to L_Ellen ."
ccw-fragment03,1675,"‘ I L_asked you a L_question , L_dear M_heart ."
ccw-fragment03,1676,L_Please be so L_good as to L_answer . ’
ccw-fragment03,1677,"‘ L_Get off this L_boat , ’ I L_told him , but my L_anger only L_amused L_Sweetman who L_unfolded his L_long L_thin L_legs from the L_cushioned L_thwart ."
ccw-fragment03,1678,"‘ L_Dick off , ’ he L_said to me ."
ccw-fragment03,1679,I was L_surprised that he so L_eagerly L_sought to M_confront me .
ccw-fragment03,1680,"I am not a L_small L_man , nor am I a L_weakling , yet the L_thin L_Sweetman L_seemed L_unconcerned as I L_jumped down into the M_cockpit ."
ccw-fragment03,1681,Then I L_saw why he was so L_confident .
ccw-fragment03,1682,He L_put a L_hand into a L_pocket of his L_elegant L_duster L_coat and L_brought out a L_small .22 L_pistol that he L_pointed at my L_face .
ccw-fragment03,1683,"‘ A L_ladies ’ L_gun , ’ he L_said , ‘ but L_remarkably L_effective at L_close L_range . ’"
ccw-fragment03,1684,‘ L_Nick ! ’
ccw-fragment03,1685,"L_Ellen L_called L_warningly , as though I might not have L_seen the L_gun ."
ccw-fragment03,1686,The L_gun 's M_threat had not L_stopped my L_advance .
ccw-fragment03,1687,"I was M_calling L_Sweetman 's L_bluff , L_confident he would not L_dare L_pull the L_trigger , and L_equally L_confident that my L_marine L_training would L_let me M_turn him into M_mincemeat ."
ccw-fragment03,1688,"I was L_also L_half L_drunk , and L_thus M_filled with the L_Dutch L_courage M_offered by L_Mama L_Sipcott 's L_worst L_white L_wine ."
ccw-fragment03,1689,L_Sweetman L_stood .
ccw-fragment03,1690,"There was , at L_last , a L_look of L_alarm on his L_face , and I could L_see him L_wondering whether he L_really would have to L_pull the L_small L_trigger ."
ccw-fragment03,1691,He L_held the L_gun L_pointed at my L_eyes .
cdb-fragment02,355,"The L_picture , very like the one L_Rufus L_Fletcher had M_taken in the L_summer of 1976 , M_occupied the L_screen for about fifteen L_seconds ."
cdb-fragment02,356,The M_whole L_item was M_allowed no more than four L_times that in the L_BBC 's L_Sunday L_evening L_news L_broadcast at 6.30 .
cdb-fragment02,357,The other L_forty-five L_seconds were L_taken up by a L_policeman L_talking to a L_reporter about having L_nothing to L_say except that there would be an L_inquest .
cdb-fragment02,358,But L_Shiva and L_Lili L_Manjusri L_saw the L_picture and so did L_Rufus L_Fletcher .
cdb-fragment02,359,"L_Adam L_Verne-Smith , M_unwinding in L_Puerto de la L_Cruz , did not of L_course L_see it ."
cdb-fragment02,360,He did not L_even L_see an L_English L_newspaper .
cdb-fragment02,361,They were L_expensive to L_buy and M_came a L_day L_late .
cdb-fragment02,362,"He did not L_want to be L_reminded of L_home and the only L_paper he L_even L_glanced at was the L_International L_Herald L_Tribune , a L_copy of which L_Anne L_found on the L_beach ."
cdb-fragment02,363,"His L_father , at L_home in L_Edgware , L_said to his L_wife :"
cdb-fragment02,364,"‘ L_Good L_God , L_Wyvis L_Hall , as I L_live and L_breathe . ’"
cdb-fragment02,365,"L_Beryl L_Verne-Smith L_peered , but the L_picture L_immediately L_vanished ."
cdb-fragment02,366,"‘ Yes , I L_suppose it was . ’"
cdb-fragment02,367,"The L_policeman L_talked , the L_reporter L_trying to M_jog him into L_revelations and L_failing ."
cdb-fragment02,368,"In the L_background , L_autumnal L_trees could be L_seen and a L_church on the L_summit of a L_low L_hill ."
cdb-fragment02,369,"L_Lewis L_Verne-Smith L_sat L_shaking his L_head , L_less as a L_gesture of L_denial than of a L_generalized L_despair at the L_state of the L_world ."
cdb-fragment02,370,"It was not that L_unpleasant L_memories were L_evoked , for these were L_always with him , his L_existence was L_inseparable from that L_old M_bitterness , but that a L_sight of the L_house , L_even the L_glimpse of a L_photograph , M_revived the L_precise L_feelings he had had — why , it must be L_getting on for L_eleven L_years L_ago ."
cdb-fragment02,371,"‘ Ten and a L_half , ’ L_said his L_wife ."
cdb-fragment02,372,‘ I shall have to L_get in L_touch with the L_police .
cdb-fragment02,373,"No two M_ways about it , I shall have to L_get in L_touch with them . ’"
cdb-fragment02,374,"‘ Not this L_evening , L_surely ? ’ L_said L_Beryl , who L_wanted to L_watch L_Mastermind ."
cdb-fragment02,375,L_Lewis L_said L_nothing .
cdb-fragment02,376,The L_room in which they were L_sitting M_underwent the M_curious M_shrinking L_process to which it was M_subject whenever he was L_reminded of L_Wyvis L_Hall or his L_Uncle L_Hilbert or L_even if the L_county of L_Suffolk were L_mentioned .
cdb-fragment02,377,L_Suddenly it L_grew L_small and L_poky .
cdb-fragment02,378,"The L_brick L_side-wall of his L_neighbour 's L_house L_seemed to have M_moved itself four or five L_feet further towards the L_dividing L_fence , so that it L_loomed L_offensively ."
cdb-fragment02,379,L_Lewis L_got up and L_pulled the L_curtains across with a M_pettish L_jerk of his L_hands .
cdb-fragment02,380,‘ Should n't you L_wait until L_Adam L_gets L_back ? ’
cdb-fragment02,381,L_Beryl L_said .
cdb-fragment02,382,‘ Why ?
cdb-fragment02,383,What would that be in L_aid of ? ’
cdb-fragment02,384,"L_Beryl L_meant that L_Adam had been among the L_previous L_owners of L_Wyvis L_Hall while her L_husband had not , but she L_knew L_better than to M_point this out ."
cdb-fragment02,385,‘ There is no one L_living L_knows that L_lovely L_place L_better than 1 . ’
cdb-fragment02,386,‘ That 's M_true . ’
cdb-fragment02,387,"‘ I L_sha n't L_wait till L_Adam L_returns , ’ L_Lewis L_said in that L_manner that had once M_led his L_daughter to L_call him the M_Frog M_Footman ,"
cdb-fragment02,388,‘ but I shall L_wait until L_tomorrow . ’
cdb-fragment02,389,"L_Men and L_women do not L_usually M_put their L_baser M_feelings and L_intentions into L_words , not L_even in the M_deep M_recesses of their own L_minds ."
cdb-fragment02,390,"So L_Lewis did not L_say , L_even to himself , when he was M_privately M_considering L_trying to M_get M_hold of his L_son in L_Tenerife , that he L_disliked L_Adam and would have been L_pleased to L_spoil his L_holiday ."
cdb-fragment02,391,"L_Instead , he L_rationalized his L_thoughts and M_justified himself L_Adam L_probably — L_indeed , L_almost L_certainly — L_knew L_nothing about the L_find in the L_pine L_wood , but L_Adam had once owned the L_house and had L_thus L_taken on a L_responsibility ."
cdb-fragment02,392,He could not M_shed that L_responsibility just because he had L_sold the L_place .
cdb-fragment02,393,L_Lewis would have L_agreed with L_Oscar L_Wilde that our L_past is what we are .
cdb-fragment02,394,We can not L_rid ourselves of it .
cdb-fragment02,395,"L_Therefore it was L_Adam 's L_duty to L_come L_home and M_face the M_music , L_even though this might be no more than a M_short M_blast on a M_tin M_whistle ."
cdb-fragment02,396,But he had no L_precise L_idea where L_Adam was and he did not L_think L_Adam 's L_travel L_agent ( a L_personal L_friend of the L_young L_Verne-Smiths ) would L_tell him .
cdb-fragment02,397,Some L_excuse would be M_made for not L_telling him .
cdb-fragment02,398,"L_Lewis 's M_bark , L_anyway , was L_always L_worse than his M_bite ."
cdb-fragment02,399,"He had L_virtually no M_bite , as he had once L_overheard L_Adam L_say to L_Bridget , and L_heard it with M_helpless L_chagrin ."
cdb-fragment02,400,‘ A M_bloody L_good M_thing or our L_childhood would have been a L_misery L_instead of just a L_bore . ’
cdb-fragment02,401,L_Lewis L_walked into his L_local L_police L_station in L_Edgware on L_Monday L_morning .
cdb-fragment02,402,They L_seemed L_surprised to L_see him but not L_astonished .
cdb-fragment02,403,The L_Suffolk L_police had L_begun M_hunting up L_previous L_owners of L_Wyvis L_Hall and they had been L_alerted that a L_Verne-Smith L_lived in their L_area .
cdb-fragment02,404,"There were , after all , only two in the L_London L_phone L_directory ."
cdb-fragment02,405,This might be a L_bonus .
cdb-fragment02,406,He was L_asked to L_wait and then L_shown into a L_room where a L_detective L_sergeant M_prepared to M_take a L_statement from him .
cdb-fragment02,407,With M_busy L_pomposity L_Lewis L_dictated it to a L_typist and would have M_gone on and on had he not been L_diplomatically M_restrained .
cdb-fragment02,408,"‘ L_Wyvis L_Hall , L_Nunes , L_Suffolk , and the twenty L_acres of L_land L_surrounding it were the L_property , through his L_marriage , of my L_uncle , L_Hilbert L_Verne-Smith ."
cdb-fragment02,409,"They M_came into the L_possession of my L_son L_Hilbert L_John L_Adam L_Verne-Smith under my L_uncle 's will , M_bypassing myself , though my L_son was no more than nineteen at the L_time of my L_uncle 's L_death ."
cdb-fragment02,410,"Being an L_undergraduate at the L_time , my L_son L_naturally L_never M_considered L_actually L_residing in the L_house ."
cdb-fragment02,411,"He was in L_agreement with my L_suggestion that the L_property be L_sold and before he L_returned to L_college in the L_autumn of 1976 , he M_took my L_advice and M_placed L_house and L_lands in the M_hands of an L_estate L_agent ."
cdb-fragment02,412,‘ L_Country L_properties were not L_selling L_well at the L_time .
cdb-fragment02,413,"£45,000 was the L_asking L_price and I was not L_surprised that the L_sale , so to L_speak , M_hung M_fire ."
cdb-fragment02,414,"L_However , in the L_spring of 1977 an L_offer was M_made , which my L_son L_accepted ."
cdb-fragment02,415,"This L_sale L_later L_fell through and it was not until the M_following L_August that L_Wyvis L_Hall was L_finally L_sold to a L_Mr and L_Mrs L_Langan for the L_much L_improved L_figure of £51,995 ."
cdb-fragment02,416,"‘ As M_far as I L_know , my L_son 's L_personal L_acquaintance with L_Wyvis L_Hall was M_confined to my L_uncle 's L_lifetime when 1 , my L_wife and L_son and L_daughter L_frequently L_stayed with him ."
cdb-fragment02,417,"After my L_uncle 's L_death in L_April 1976 he L_visited L_Wyvis L_Hall on L_perhaps two , or at the most three , M_separate L_occasions L_simply for the L_purpose of L_looking it over and M_reaching a L_decision about the L_disposal of L_furniture and L_effects ."
cdb-fragment02,418,‘ I L_suppose it is L_possible that L_squatters or other L_vagrants M_took L_possession of the L_house between the L_time of my L_uncle 's L_death and the L_sale of the L_property .
cdb-fragment02,419,L_Certainly my L_son L_never L_let it or L_allowed L_anyone to L_occupy it on either a L_temporary or L_permanent L_basis .
cdb-fragment02,420,‘ My L_son is at L_present on L_holiday in L_Tenerife with his L_wife and L_daughter .
cdb-fragment02,421,"I can not L_say L_precisely when I L_expect him to L_return , though I should L_suppose in about a L_week from now . ’"
cdb-fragment02,422,It was all very M_small and M_quiet and L_low-key .
cdb-fragment02,423,The L_snippet in L_Rufus 's L_Monday L_morning L_newspaper M_measured just an M_inch in M_depth .
cdb-fragment02,424,It M_answered the L_question he had L_asked himself and M_told him that the L_bones of a very L_young L_child had been L_found as L_well as those of a L_young L_woman.
cdb-fragment02,424a,This was not a M_shock .
cdb-fragment02,425,"How could it be L_otherwise , since this was L_Wyvis L_Hall and the L_pine L_wood and the L_animal L_cemetery ?"
cdb-fragment02,426,"To L_photograph the L_house for the L_news L_last L_night the L_cameraman must have L_stood just where he had L_stood himself , on the L_edge of the L_lawn with his L_back to the L_cedar L_tree ."
cdb-fragment02,427,A L_popular .
cdb-fragment02,428,"L_mass-produced L_camera he had L_used , but L_quite a L_good one ."
cdb-fragment02,429,"One M_thing about L_Zosie 's L_pilfering , she L_never L_stole M_rubbish ."
cdb-fragment02,430,He had M_taken a L_picture of her after that and one of the L_animal L_cemetery .
cdb-fragment02,431,‘ Why is the L_grass L_always so L_short up here ? ’
cdb-fragment02,432,L_Adam had L_asked .
cdb-fragment02,433,"‘ L_Rabbits , I L_expect . ’"
cdb-fragment02,434,‘ Why ca n't M_bloody L_rabbits L_come and L_eat my L_lawns ? ’
cdb-fragment02,435,"L_Adam L_always L_referred to ‘ my L_lawns ’ , ‘ my L_house ’ , ‘ my L_furniture ’ ."
cdb-fragment02,436,"It had M_got up L_Rufus 's M_nose a L_bit , though L_Adam had a L_perfect L_right to do this ."
cdb-fragment02,437,"It was his , all of it , and it M_went to his M_head L_rather ."
cdb-fragment02,438,"L_Nineteen-year-olds L_seldom L_inherit L_country L_mansions , after all ."
cdb-fragment02,439,"It must have been some L_time in L_August when I M_took those L_pictures , L_Rufus L_thought , and a M_couple of L_weeks L_later it was all over ."
cdb-fragment02,440,"L_Coincidentally , as the L_community and their L_lives L_together M_broke up , so did the L_weather ."
cdb-fragment02,441,"It was L_raining L_intermittently all the L_time they were in the L_cemetery , the L_pines M_bowing and M_shivering in the L_wind ."
cdb-fragment02,442,L_Sometimes they had had to L_stop and M_take L_shelter under the L_closely L_planted-trees .
cdb-fragment02,443,If the L_weather had M_held and L_still been L_hot and L_dry would they have L_dug L_deeper ?
cdb-fragment02,444,L_Probably not .
cdb-fragment02,445,"In L_spite of the L_rain , the L_earth was L_still as L_hard as M_iron ."
cdb-fragment02,446,"A M_sheet of L_rain had L_come down then , a M_hard , L_gusty M_shower , while they were L_laying the L_squares of L_turf M_back in L_place , and L_Adam had L_said L_something about the L_rain M_making the L_grass L_grow L_quickly , the L_rain being on their M_side ."
cdb-fragment02,447,"‘ We should all L_go our M_separate L_ways as L_soon as we can , ’ L_Rufus had L_said ."
cdb-fragment02,448,‘ We should L_pack up now and L_go . ’
cdb-fragment02,449,The L_spade and the L_fork they had L_hung up among the other L_tools in the L_stables .
cdb-fragment02,450,They had L_packed and L_Adam had L_locked up the L_house .
cdb-fragment02,451,At some M_point L_Rufus himself had L_taken the L_things out of the L_fridge and L_left the L_door L_open to L_defrost it .
cdb-fragment02,452,L_Adam L_closed the L_front L_door and L_stood there for a L_moment as if he could not M_wrench himself L_away .
cdb-fragment02,453,So L_much of its L_beauty had been M_stripped from it by the M_whipping L_winds .
cdb-fragment02,454,And by the M_neglect of the M_long L_hot L_summer .
cdb-fragment02,455,A L_sudden L_gust of L_rain M_dashed against the L_red L_bricks that were L_already L_stained in L_patches by L_water .
cdb-fragment02,456,"The L_house that when he L_first L_saw it had L_seemed to M_float on a M_raft of M_golden M_mist , now M_lay in a L_wilderness , amidst M_ragged L_grass and M_straggling L_bushes and L_trees L_dead from the L_heat ."
cdb-fragment02,457,"M_Dirty L_grey L_clouds M_tumbled across the L_sky above the L_slate L_roof , now the only L_thing that M_shone , M_glazed with L_rain ."
cdb-fragment02,458,But L_Rufus M_admitted to himself that the L_beauties of L_nature and L_architecture had L_never M_meant L_much to him .
cdb-fragment02,459,It was the L_heat and L_sunshine and L_privacy he L_liked .
cdb-fragment02,460,And now he L_longed only to L_get L_away .
cdb-fragment02,461,"They all L_got into L_Goblander and he L_drove L_away up the L_drift , L_Adam L_next to him , the L_others in the M_back ."
cdb-fragment02,462,The L_drift had L_become a M_tunnel of L_overgrowth that L_dripped L_water on to the L_roof of the L_van .
cdb-fragment02,463,L_None of them M_allowed their L_eyes to M_turn towards the L_pine L_wood .
cdb-fragment02,464,"At the L_top they L_came out into M_uncompromising , L_bright L_grey L_light , the L_bleak , L_hedgeless L_lane , the L_flat L_meadows where here and there L_stunted L_trees M_squatted like M_old M_men in M_cloaks ."
cdb-fragment02,465,"L_Adam 's L_simile , not his , L_thought L_Rufus with a L_grimace ."
cdb-fragment02,466,No L_one L_asked where he was L_taking them .
cdb-fragment02,467,No L_one L_spoke .
cdb-fragment02,468,L_Adam had L_Hilbert 's L_old L_golf-bag L_stuck between his L_legs and L_Rufus L_guessed the L_gun was inside it .
cdb-fragment02,469,They must have L_gone a L_good two L_miles before they M_met another L_car .
cdb-fragment02,470,L_Rufus L_overtook a L_bus M_going to L_Colchester and M_dropped the two in the M_back so that they could M_catch it .
cdb-fragment02,471,He L_took L_Adam on to L_Sudbury for him to M_catch a L_train there and at that M_point they L_parted .
cdb-fragment02,472,"L_Adam L_got down from L_Goblander and L_said ,"
cdb-fragment02,473,"‘ For L_ever and for L_ever , L_farewell , L_Rufus . ’"
cdb-fragment02,474,"Which was L_probably a L_quotation from L_something , though L_Rufus did not L_know what and L_thought L_fastidiously that it was in L_bad M_taste , L_histrionic , though just like L_Adam ."
cdb-fragment02,475,"‘ M_Take L_care , ’ L_said L_Rufus , and not L_looking L_back any more than he had done when they L_returned from the L_cemetery , L_drove off L_round the L_town he had L_got to L_know so L_well , over the L_Stour L_bridge , into L_Essex , L_heading for L_Halstead and L_Dunmow and L_Ongar and L_London ."
cdb-fragment02,476,He L_never had L_seen any of them again .
cdb-fragment02,477,"There had been no L_need to L_pretend , to L_turn L_aside ."
cdb-fragment02,478,"L_Briefly , L_starting his L_fifth L_year in L_medical L_school L_something over thirteen L_months L_later , he had L_wondered if L_Shiva L_Manjusri would be one of the L_incoming L_freshmen ."
cdb-fragment02,479,"But no , his L_intuition had been M_accurate ."
cdb-fragment02,480,At any M_rate L_Shiva 's L_face was not among the L_several L_brown L_faces .
cdb-fragment02,481,"As for the L_others , L_avoiding them had M_presented no L_problems ."
cdb-fragment02,482,Would they L_get in L_touch with him now ?
cdb-fragment02,483,No L_contingency M_plans had been M_made for this L_eventuality .
cdb-fragment02,484,So L_long as there was no M_hunt for a L_missing L_girl they had M_felt themselves L_reasonably M_safe .
cdb-fragment02,485,Their L_minds had not M_reached out to the L_terror of what had in L_fact L_happened .
cdb-fragment02,486,L_None of them had been the L_kind of L_people who could have L_imagined M_devotion to a L_pet L_animal or L_according to it L_funerary L_rites .
cdb-fragment02,487,It was L_Shiva who had L_proposed the L_site .
cdb-fragment02,488,They had L_congratulated him on his L_ingenuity .
cdb-fragment02,489,Ten L_years …
cdb-fragment02,490,"An L_ovarian L_cyst , L_nothing to L_get M_upset about , L_Rufus L_told L_Ms L_Beauchamp ."
cdb-fragment02,491,"She was thirty-two , an L_editor with a L_distinguished L_publishing L_house , L_married to an L_investigative L_journalist ."
cdb-fragment02,492,"As L_yet they had no L_children , but she L_wanted four , she L_told L_Rufus ."
cdb-fragment02,493,‘ No L_reason why you should n't . ’
cdb-fragment02,494,He had another L_glance at her L_notes .
cdb-fragment02,495,"‘ In L_fact , a L_peculiarity about this L_condition is that it L_seldom if L_ever L_occurs in a L_woman who 's had a L_baby . ’"
cdb-fragment02,496,"‘ My L_God , ’ she L_said , L_putting her L_coat on , ."
cdb-fragment02,497,"'and there was 1 , M_making my L_husband 's L_life a L_misery , L_sure I 'd M_got the L_dreaded C. ’"
cdb-fragment02,498,"They all L_thought they 'd M_got the L_dreaded C , M_poor M_things ."
cdb-fragment02,499,You could n't L_blame them .
cdb-fragment02,500,"L_Rufus L_took her £40 off her by the L_reception L_desk , having M_set in M_train the L_arrangements by which she would be M_admitted to a L_fashionable L_West L_End L_clinic , with L_Rufus , her L_surgery and her L_hospitalization L_ultimately L_paid for by some L_provident L_association to which she and her L_husband L_subscribed ."
cdb-fragment02,501,L_Rufus L_shook L_hands .
cdb-fragment02,502,"He L_walked M_back to his L_consulting L_room , M_dying for a L_cigarette ."
cdb-fragment02,503,This was unlike him .
cdb-fragment02,504,He could L_usually M_get through L_quite L_easily until after L_lunch .
cdb-fragment02,505,"He L_thought , I L_know what my L_idea of L_heaven would be , if by L_heaven we L_mean a L_place of L_bliss in which to M_pass L_eternity : a L_sanctuary where one L_might L_chain-smoke without L_impairment of L_breathing , L_destruction of the L_lungs or L_damage to the L_heart , L_light each M_fresh L_cigarette from the L_glowing M_butt of its M_predecessor , and L_drink L_ice-free but L_hundred-proof L_chilled L_vodka M_laced with two L_drops of L_angostura and a L_gill of L_newly L_opened L_Perrier L_endlessly , with L_increasing L_euphoria until a M_peak of L_joy and L_ease was M_reached but without any L_sub-sequent L_nausea or L_pain or L_dehydration or L_oblivion …"
cdb-fragment02,506,"L_Sitting L_alone , he L_lit his L_cigarette , the L_first of the L_day , and there M_came that M_faint M_swimming in the L_head , a L_tautening of the L_gut ."
cdb-fragment02,507,He L_closed his L_eyes .
cdb-fragment02,508,"If it M_comes to M_light that I was in that L_house with L_Adam and the L_others , he L_thought with M_cold M_clarity , if L_someone M_tells the L_papers , or the L_police and L_thence the L_papers , that I was there during the L_summer of 1976 , L_living there , it will be all up with me ."
cdb-fragment02,509,"I will M_lose my L_practice and my L_reputation and L_everything that I have and can M_look M_forward to , if not my L_liberty ."
cdb-fragment02,510,And without the L_rest I L_sha n't L_care about my L_liberty .
cdb-fragment02,511,"It would be L_bad L_enough if I were a G P or an L_expert in some other M_branch of L_medicine , an L_orthopaedic L_surgeon , for L_instance , or an L_ear , L_nose and L_throat L_man , but I am a L_gynaecologist , and it is the L_bones of a L_young L_woman and a L_baby that have been L_found there …"
cdb-fragment02,512,What L_worried L_woman would L_come to me ?
cdb-fragment02,513,What L_Mrs L_Strawson or L_Ms L_Beauchamp ?
cdb-fragment02,514,What L_GP would L_send her to me ?
cdb-fragment02,515,"If I were L_innocent , L_thought L_Rufus , I L_know very L_well what I would do ."
cdb-fragment02,516,I would L_pick up the L_phone and L_phone my L_solicitor and L_ask to L_come and L_see him and M_get his L_advice .
cdb-fragment02,517,He might L_advise me to M_make a L_statement to the L_police which I should of L_course do under his M_guidance .
cdb-fragment02,518,But I shall not do this because I am not L_innocent .
cdb-fragment02,519,"I shall L_sit here and L_wait and M_sweat it out and M_look the L_facts in the M_face , L_trying to L_anticipate the L_worst that can L_happen ."
cdb-fragment04,855,"The L_wonderful M_thing about the L_human L_mind , L_Adam L_thought , is the M_way it M_copes when the L_worst L_happens ."
cdb-fragment04,856,"Beyond that L_worst L_happening you L_think there can be L_nothing , the L_unimaginable has M_taken M_place , and on the other M_side is L_death , L_destruction , the M_end ."
cdb-fragment04,857,"But the L_worst L_happens and you M_reel from it , you M_stagger , the M_shock is M_enormous , and then you L_begin to M_recover ."
cdb-fragment04,858,"You M_rally , you M_stand up and M_face it ."
cdb-fragment04,859,You L_get L_used to it .
cdb-fragment04,860,An L_hour L_maybe and you are M_making L_contingency M_plans .
cdb-fragment04,861,"For what had L_happened was not the L_worst , you L_realized that ."
cdb-fragment04,862,"The L_worst was L_yet to M_come , was L_perhaps L_always L_yet to M_come , L_never would L_actually M_come , because if it did you would L_know it , that would be L_reality , and there would be L_nothing then but to L_kill yourself ."
cdb-fragment04,863,L_Quickly .
cdb-fragment04,864,"Now that he was L_able to , he M_assembled what had L_happened and M_laid the L_facts before himself ."
cdb-fragment04,865,They had L_dug up those L_bones at L_Wyvis L_Hall and had L_decided it was L_murder they were L_investigating .
cdb-fragment04,866,"L_Bones , L_skeletons , L_bodies , do not L_bury themselves ."
cdb-fragment04,867,"Those were the L_facts , as M_far as he L_knew them up to this L_moment ."
cdb-fragment04,868,"He would L_know more , L_much more , in the L_days to M_come ."
cdb-fragment04,869,What was L_certain was that he could no L_longer L_use the L_escape L_key .
cdb-fragment04,870,It was L_defunct .
cdb-fragment04,871,"The M_passages it L_cancelled had , in any L_case , as in L_certain L_programmes , not been M_lost but M_stored on some M_limbo L_disc from L_whence they must now be M_retrieved ."
cdb-fragment04,872,"L_Adam L_sat in his L_parents ' L_house , L_drinking L_tea ."
cdb-fragment04,873,"There must be a L_total M_retrieval now , the one L_good M_thing about which was that it might M_banish his L_dreams ."
cdb-fragment04,874,"He was L_aware of a M_slight L_feeling of L_sickness and of L_cold , an L_absence of L_hunger , though he had been M_feeling L_quite L_hungry when he L_got off the L_plane ."
cdb-fragment04,875,"L_Anne L_sat L_next to him on his L_mother 's L_cretonne-covered L_settee and L_Abigail L_lay on a L_plaid L_rug on the L_floor , L_kicking with her L_legs and L_punching with her L_arms ."
cdb-fragment04,876,His L_mother L_kept L_poking L_toys which she did not L_want at her .
cdb-fragment04,877,A M_passage from a L_novel by L_John O'Hara M_came M_back to L_Adam .
cdb-fragment04,878,"He had L_memorized it L_years L_ago in the L_Ecalpemos L_epoch : ‘ The L_safest M_way to L_live is L_first , L_inherit L_money , L_second , be L_born without M_taste for L_liquor , L_third , have a L_legitimate L_job that L_keeps you L_busy , L_fourth , L_marry a L_wife who will L_cooperate in your L_sexual L_peculiarities , L_fifth , M_join some M_big L_church , L_sixth , do n't L_live too L_long . ’"
cdb-fragment04,879,L_Apart from the L_last one which he had n't M_got to L_yet and the L_penultimate one which L_seemed to L_apply in L_America more than here ( here he had M_joined the L_golf L_club ) he had L_complied with all the L_rest .
cdb-fragment04,880,Or his M_nature and L_luck had M_complied for him .
cdb-fragment04,881,M_Nemesis had L_still M_come down like the M_wolf on the M_fold .
cdb-fragment04,882,He had not L_wanted to L_come L_back here .
cdb-fragment04,883,"But there had been no M_spirit in him , the M_shock of what his L_father L_told him had been too M_great ."
cdb-fragment04,884,"‘ L_Something that will L_interest you , L_Adam , L_something to M_make you M_sit up ."
cdb-fragment04,885,They 've L_dug up a M_lot of L_human L_bones at my L_old L_uncle 's L_house … ‘
cdb-fragment04,886,By the L_time he had M_rallied and M_got himself M_together and was L_thinking of M_things to L_say to the L_police it was too L_late and they were L_heading L_north .
cdb-fragment04,887,L_Anne was L_furious .
cdb-fragment04,888,When L_Lewis L_said to L_come L_back with him and L_eat there L_Adam had M_got a L_kick on the L_ankle from L_Anne and another L_kick when he had n't L_replied .
cdb-fragment04,889,"He had M_turned on her and L_said with M_cold L_savagery , ‘ For L_fuck 's L_sake , L_stop L_kicking me , will you ? ’"
cdb-fragment04,890,"He L_expected his L_father to M_rise and L_say L_something about that being no M_way to L_speak to L_one 's L_wife or not in L_front of the L_child , he was L_capable of that ."
cdb-fragment04,891,"But he had L_said L_nothing , only L_looked L_subdued , and L_Adam L_realized why ."
cdb-fragment04,892,His own L_terrible L_fear and L_anger had M_communicated itself to his L_father and M_shown him what the L_better M_part of L_valour was : L_keeping L_silent .
cdb-fragment04,893,"Having M_put the M_cat among the M_pigeons , M_made L_mischief in his L_special M_way , he was M_lying M_low now and L_waiting ."
cdb-fragment04,894,The L_old M_bastard .
cdb-fragment04,895,"L_Adam only L_wished L_Uncle L_Hilbert had M_left him L_Wyvis L_Hall and then there would have been no L_Ecalpemos , no L_Zosie , and no L_deaths ."
cdb-fragment04,896,And L_Adam could n't M_see he would have been L_much L_worse off .
cdb-fragment04,897,"He and L_Anne would be L_living in a L_house like this one , L_rather than that L_neo-Georgian M_palace ."
cdb-fragment04,898,"L_Children , after all , he L_thought , L_looking at L_Abigail , were L_happy wherever they were , so L_long as they were L_loved …"
cdb-fragment04,899,His L_parents had not L_asked him what L_sort of L_holiday he had had or how the L_flight had been .
cdb-fragment04,900,The L_conversation was L_exclusively on the M_subject of the L_discovery at L_Wyvis L_Hall .
cdb-fragment04,901,L_Adam did not L_know whether to be L_glad or L_sorry he had not L_obtained an L_English L_newspaper while L_away .
cdb-fragment04,902,"If he had done the M_shock would have been L_less but on the other M_hand , his L_holiday would have been M_spoilt ."
cdb-fragment04,903,He would have L_liked very L_much to be L_alone .
cdb-fragment04,904,"Of L_course he L_knew there was no L_possibility of this , now or when he L_returned L_home , for when you were L_married you L_never could be L_alone ."
cdb-fragment04,905,L_Presumably that was the M_point .
cdb-fragment04,906,What was he L_going to L_tell L_Anne ?
cdb-fragment04,907,How L_much was he L_going to L_tell her ?
cdb-fragment04,908,He did n't L_know .
cdb-fragment04,909,"L_None of it , if he could M_help it ."
cdb-fragment04,910,They L_sat at the L_table in the L_dining L_area to L_eat an L_absurdly L_early M_high L_tea .
cdb-fragment04,911,L_Lewis L_asked him if he could L_remember the L_day when he L_heard he had L_inherited L_Wyvis L_Hall and had L_walked in here and L_astounded them with his L_news .
cdb-fragment04,912,"‘ He had a L_beard then , L_Anne . ’"
cdb-fragment04,913,L_Lewis 's M_subdued M_air had M_changed to one of M_high L_good L_humour .
cdb-fragment04,914,"‘ You would n't have L_recognized him , he L_looked like M_John the M_Baptist . ’"
cdb-fragment04,915,L_Adam could L_remember very L_well but he was n't M_going to L_say so .
cdb-fragment04,916,"‘ What a M_funny M_thing , ’ L_said L_Lewis ."
cdb-fragment04,917,‘ We had L_ham L_salad that L_day too .
cdb-fragment04,918,What a L_coincidence !
cdb-fragment04,919,"Oh , yes , I 've been L_meaning to L_ask you , who was it M_looked after L_Wyvis L_Hall while you were in L_Greece ? ’"
cdb-fragment04,920,L_Adam could L_eat L_nothing .
cdb-fragment04,921,"The other L_time , he L_remembered , it was his L_father who had n't been L_able to L_eat ."
cdb-fragment04,922,"He did n't L_know what L_Lewis L_meant about L_someone M_looking after the L_house but no L_doubt he , L_Adam , had at the L_time M_concocted some M_tale to M_keep his L_father L_quiet , to M_keep him L_away L_even ."
cdb-fragment04,923,"‘ L_Someone from the L_village , you L_said , ’ L_Lewis L_persisted ."
cdb-fragment04,924,‘ How can I L_remember that M_far M_back ? ’
cdb-fragment04,925,‘ The L_police will L_want to L_know .
cdb-fragment04,926,It may be of M_vital L_importance . ’
cdb-fragment04,927,"‘ Are n't you M_going to L_eat your L_meat , L_dear ? ’ L_said L_Beryl ."
cdb-fragment04,928,"L_Abigail , who had been L_put L_upstairs in one of the L_bedrooms to L_sleep , M_set up a L_wailing L_sound ."
cdb-fragment04,929,L_Adam was on his L_feet at once .
cdb-fragment04,930,‘ I L_think we should L_go . ’
cdb-fragment04,931,They had to L_wait until his L_father was L_ready .
cdb-fragment04,932,L_Adam would have L_preferred to L_phone for a L_hire L_car but L_Lewis would n't L_hear of it .
cdb-fragment04,933,L_Anne L_sat in the L_front in the L_passenger L_seat while L_Adam was in the M_back with L_Abigail .
cdb-fragment04,934,"If his L_father could have L_found out what L_flight they were L_coming on , the L_police L_certainly could ."
cdb-fragment04,935,It was L_possible they might be L_waiting for him .
cdb-fragment04,936,They would L_wish to L_interview every L_former L_owner or L_occupant of L_Wyvis L_Hall .
cdb-fragment04,937,He L_looked again at the L_newspaper M_account of the L_adjourned L_inquest that his L_father had M_saved for him .
cdb-fragment04,938,"It would be L_owners and L_occupants of L_Wyvis L_Hall between nine and twelve L_years before that they would L_wish to L_interview , and those were L_Great-Uncle L_Hilbert , who was L_dead , himself and L_Ivan L_Langan to whom he had L_sold the L_house ."
cdb-fragment04,939,"As for other L_occupants , how would they L_know who L_else had L_lived there ?"
cdb-fragment04,940,It was L_ironical that ten L_days before he had L_seen L_Shiva at L_Heathrow .
cdb-fragment04,941,"The L_encounter he now M_saw as an M_omen , a M_shadow M_cast by a L_coming L_event ."
cdb-fragment04,942,What would that L_event be ?
cdb-fragment04,943,"L_Adam did not L_want at this M_point to L_speculate , it M_made hi– M_feel M_sick ."
cdb-fragment04,944,He L_turned the L_newspaper over so that he could not L_see that L_headline and those L_paragraphs .
cdb-fragment04,945,"In M_high M_spirits , his L_father was L_talking about the M_immense M_advances M_made in L_forensic L_science in L_recent L_years ."
cdb-fragment04,946,"As L_soon as they L_got L_home , L_Anne L_started L_getting L_Abigail to L_bed ."
cdb-fragment04,947,"Their L_cases L_humped L_upstairs and L_put into the L_bedroom , L_Adam L_looked L_Rufus L_Fletcher up in the L_phone L_book ."
cdb-fragment04,948,"He was in there L_twice , at a L_Wimpole L_Street L_number and again at an L_address in L_Mill L_Hill : L_Rufus H. L_Fletcher , L_MB , L_MRCP ."
cdb-fragment04,949,"All these L_years then , or for some of them , L_Rufus had been L_living three or four L_miles from him ."
cdb-fragment04,950,He could n't L_look L_Shiva up because he could n't L_remember his L_surname .
cdb-fragment04,951,"L_Women L_marry and M_change their L_names , he L_thought , there was no M_point in M_pursuing that one ."
cdb-fragment04,952,"Of L_course he could L_look up L_Robin L_Tatian but where , L_really , would that M_get him ?"
cdb-fragment04,953,"He was L_reaching-for the L_blue L_directory when L_Anne L_came L_back with L_Abigail in her L_arms , so L_Adam L_took her and L_carried her M_back to L_bed himself and L_tucked her in and L_kissed her ."
cdb-fragment04,954,She was L_almost L_asleep .
cdb-fragment04,955,He L_wondered if L_Rufus had L_children and if so did he M_worry about them M_coming to L_terrible L_harm the M_way L_Adam M_worried ?
cdb-fragment04,956,Was his M_whole L_life L_affected by what had L_happened at L_Ecalpemos ?
cdb-fragment04,957,"L_Adam might have M_escaped the L_file L_memories for L_years , M_suppressed them and M_jerked L_violently M_away from them , but he had L_never been L_able to L_pretend he was L_unscathed by those L_events ."
cdb-fragment04,958,L_Sometimes he M_felt that he was the L_person he was because of them and L_acted the M_way he did because of their L_effects .
cdb-fragment04,959,"He L_sat by L_Abigail 's L_cot , not L_wanting to L_remember , but L_knowing that now he must ."
cdb-fragment04,960,There was L_nothing in his L_house to L_remind him of L_Ecalpemos .
cdb-fragment04,961,"L_Everything that was L_left , L_everything he and L_Rufus had n't L_sold , had M_gone to L_Ivan L_Langan with the L_house ."
cdb-fragment04,962,"For a M_song , too , because he had not been L_able to M_bear the L_thought of L_going L_back , L_meeting a L_valuer , L_walking about the L_house , L_picking L_things off L_shelves and out of L_cupboards ."
cdb-fragment04,963,"Only once had he L_returned after they all L_left and that had been L_bad L_enough , like a M_dream — no , like M_stepping into the M_set and M_scenario of some M_frightening M_film , a M_Hitchcock M_movie L_perhaps ."
cdb-fragment04,964,He L_asked the L_taxi he had M_taken to M_put him down at the M_top of the L_drift and he had L_walked to the L_house .
cdb-fragment04,965,"It was L_almost a L_year since he had been there and in that L_time L_nothing had been done , L_nothing had been L_touched ."
cdb-fragment04,966,From the L_pine L_wood he L_simply L_averted his L_eyes — till L_later .
cdb-fragment04,967,"The L_drift was L_thickly L_overgrown , a L_dank L_tunnel out of whose L_bushy L_sides the L_tendrils of L_brambles and L_briar L_roses M_caught at his L_clothes ."
cdb-fragment04,968,One of these M_whipped M_back at him and as he L_caught at it a L_thorn M_drove into the L_fleshy M_pad of his L_finger .
cdb-fragment04,969,"That L_thorn had been there , L_festering , for L_months ."
cdb-fragment04,970,"A M_dull L_cool L_summer it had been , as L_different as could be from the L_year before ."
cdb-fragment04,971,No M_golden L_light M_bathed the L_red L_brick of the L_house .
cdb-fragment04,972,It no L_longer L_looked L_mellow .
cdb-fragment04,973,"L_Beautiful , yes , but M_severe L_somehow and , to L_Adam 's L_heightened L_awareness , M_reproachful ."
cdb-fragment04,974,"He M_found himself M_encouraging , M_fostering , the M_scenario L_illusion ."
cdb-fragment04,975,"Only L_thus , only by L_pretending L_unreality , L_pretending this was a M_part he L_acted , could he L_go on , L_cross the L_wild , M_shaggy L_grass , L_go past the L_black-branched L_cedar L_tree , L_arrive at the L_porch L_set in its four L_Doric L_columns and L_insert his L_key in the L_lock ."
clp-fragment01,744,L_Conclusion
clp-fragment01,745,L_Task L_analysis has not and can not be M_reduced to a L_set of L_standardised L_procedures which the L_aspiring L_analyst could M_acquire in a M_formal M_training M_course .
clp-fragment01,746,The L_techniques just L_described are no more than L_guidelines in what L_remains the M_creative L_art of L_studying and L_describing what an L_experienced L_worker is doing or will be L_required to do .
clp-fragment01,747,The L_danger in being too M_rigid is that L_justice will not be done to the M_flexibility and L_complexity of L_human L_performance .
clp-fragment01,748,"The L_danger of being too M_flexible is that the L_ergonomists will have an L_inadequate L_basis from which to M_design L_interfaces , M_training M_courses and other L_operator L_aids ."
clp-fragment01,749,If a L_comprehensive L_task L_description can be L_completed then it is L_legitimate to L_enquire why the L_task can not be L_allocated to a L_technical L_device L_rather than a L_human being .
clp-fragment01,750,L_Yet without a L_reasonably L_comprehensive L_task L_description the L_total L_system M_performance may be L_unreliable or L_unpredictable .
clp-fragment01,751,There is a L_necessary L_compromise which can only be M_arrived at in the M_context of a L_particular L_system .
clp-fragment01,752,As M_mentioned L_earlier there are L_always the M_twin L_problems of how to M_get the L_information and how to M_present it .
clp-fragment01,753,"It is L_sometimes L_easier to M_proceed on the L_basis of : ‘ If I were doing the L_job this is how I would do it ’ , but this can be L_delusory L_even for L_analysts who have L_past L_experience as L_operators ."
clp-fragment01,754,"For L_analysts who are L_designers M_creating a L_new L_task there may be no L_alternative , but any L_task L_description M_arrived at by this L_method should be L_checked against the L_behaviour of L_real L_operators as they M_gain L_experience ."
clp-fragment01,755,A L_particular L_difficulty about L_task M_synthesis is that there is no L_easy M_way of L_confirming L_completeness .
clp-fragment01,756,"A L_task L_description which is M_part of a M_design L_process should be L_fully — L_documented in L_terms of the M_origins of L_information , the L_assumptions M_made and the L_methods L_used ."
clp-fragment01,757,The L_standard L_method of M_producing L_task L_descriptions is to L_write all the L_separate L_sub-tasks at L_various M_levels on L_cards and then M_assemble the L_cards in a M_network .
clp-fragment01,758,"There is a L_temptation to L_make these L_final L_diagrams very L_large , but L_often it is more L_useful to M_separate into M_small M_units with L_cross-referencing ."
clp-fragment01,759,"The L_optimum L_size L_seems to be A3 , this is L_easily L_copied and M_circulated but is L_large L_enough to M_contain L_considerable L_detail ."
clp-fragment01,760,"The L_procedure can be L_computerised , there are L_programmes L_available for the L_easy M_production , M_manipulation and M_storage of M_block L_diagrams with L_useful L_cross-referencing M_facilities ."
clp-fragment01,761,There is an L_inherent L_difficulty in that L_often the L_main L_dividend from a L_task L_analysis is from the L_act of L_obtaining it .
clp-fragment01,762,Those not L_involved M_find it L_difficult to M_gain very L_much from a L_presentation of a L_task L_description .
clp-fragment01,763,"Like L_reference L_books , they have to be L_used L_rather than L_read ."
clp-fragment01,764,"L_Task L_analysis can be very L_expensive in L_skilled L_manpower , but in M_looking at cost/value it is L_important to M_include in L_value the L_increase in L_mutual L_understanding which L_occurs when a L_multi-disciplinary L_team M_conducts the L_analysis ."
clp-fragment01,765,If such a L_team is L_used the L_required L_man-hours can be L_optimised by L_using the L_Delphi L_method L_rather than a M_long L_series of L_group L_meetings .
clp-fragment01,766,"L_Political , L_economic and L_social L_issues which M_arise in M_conducting L_Task L_Analyses are M_discussed in the M_context of L_Job L_Analysis ( p. 148 ) ."
clp-fragment01,767,M_Application
clp-fragment01,768,L_Man-power L_planning
clp-fragment01,769,The ‘ L_Human M_Resource ’ L_concept of L_man-power as the M_central profit­generating M_asset of any L_organisation has M_made some M_progress over the L_past twenty L_years .
clp-fragment01,770,"There was L_particular L_interest around 1970 when L_companies were L_prosperous , M_stable and L_innovative ( L_IPM , 1972 , L_Patten , 1971 ) ."
clp-fragment01,771,"The L_objective is to L_revise and L_almost M_reverse the L_traditional L_accountancy L_concept of L_man-power as a M_resource M_consuming L_factor L_requiring L_regular L_payments , L_overheads in the M_form of L_heated , L_lighted , L_equipped L_workspaces and so on ."
clp-fragment01,772,"From the M_narrow L_accountancy M_viewpoint , L_people are a L_cost and it is M_desirable to M_keep this L_cost as M_low as L_possible ."
clp-fragment01,773,"In these L_terms it is very L_difficult to L_justify , for L_example , L_sending a M_member of L_staff on a M_training M_course ."
clp-fragment01,774,The M_training L_requires L_expenditure and so L_also does the L_replacement for the L_person L_away .
clp-fragment01,775,Where is the M_return ?
clp-fragment01,776,The M_return is L_actually in the L_improved L_human M_resource but this is not L_readily L_measurable in L_terms which L_accountants L_use .
clp-fragment01,777,"There have been two L_attempts to M_reduce L_human M_resources to this M_form of M_measurement ( L_Giles and L_Robinson , 1972 ) ."
clp-fragment01,778,One is to M_acquire a L_human M_asset L_multiplier for each M_level of L_staff .
clp-fragment01,779,The L_multiplier for L_manual L_staff might be L_unity but it L_increases with L_staff M_level and L_becomes three or more for L_management .
clp-fragment01,780,The other is to L_add M_together all the L_personnel L_costs for each L_kind of L_worker from the L_original L_job L_advertisement through to the L_retirement or L_redundancy L_payments .
clp-fragment01,781,"The L_first does M_attempt to M_obtain a L_value , the L_second L_remains L_essentially a L_cost and not a L_value ."
clp-fragment01,782,It would be L_unduly L_optimistic to M_assume that L_management L_skills have M_risen to a M_level such that L_costs M_undertaken can be M_assumed to be L_equivalent to L_value .
clp-fragment01,783,A L_less M_direct M_measure which is L_applicable only to the most M_senior L_management is to L_observe the M_fall or M_rise of the L_share L_price when a L_particular L_executive M_leaves or M_joins a L_company .
clp-fragment01,784,"This can be very M_high , for a M_large L_company a L_change in M_market L_value of L_millions of L_pounds is not L_unusual ."
clp-fragment01,785,The most M_serious L_consequence of the L_accountancy M_view of L_man-power is that M_high M_level L_policy L_decision-making does not M_give this L_factor L_sufficient M_weight .
clp-fragment01,786,"For L_example , the L_main L_board of a L_company will have L_complete L_details of L_cost and L_values of L_physical M_resources such as L_buildings and L_equipment but L_relatively M_scanty L_data about the L_man-power which is their most L_important M_asset ."
clp-fragment01,787,L_Indeed it will be M_described L_almost L_entirely as a L_liability because the L_costs will be L_known .
clp-fragment01,788,"L_Similarly , M_broad L_factors such as the M_state of L_morale will again only be L_described by M_negative M_features such as L_absenteeism , L_stoppages , M_strikes , M_low L_quality L_output and so on ."
clp-fragment01,789,"It is L_obvious that L_company L_output and L_projects must M_reflect the L_man-power and its M_performance M_level , but , if this is L_acknowledged at all , it is only in M_brief L_verbal L_terms within , for L_example , the L_chairman 's L_annual L_report ."
clp-fragment01,790,"The L_obsession , of L_current L_management , with L_measurement and the M_reduction of every L_variable to L_numbers for L_ease of L_computer M_manipulation has L_worsened the M_situation ."
clp-fragment01,791,L_Unfortunately there is no L_easy M_remedy .
clp-fragment01,792,L_Human M_resources are too L_complex a L_variable to be L_easily M_susceptible to L_measurement beyond the M_level of L_counting L_heads and L_trades .
clp-fragment01,793,L_Key L_variables such as the L_quality of L_staff at any M_level and the L_current L_morale are only M_expressible in L_general L_verbal L_descriptive L_terms .
clp-fragment01,794,"It is L_generally L_accepted ( p. 145 ) that ‘ L_hygiene ’ L_type L_variables such as L_pay and L_working L_conditions can , if they are L_inappropriately L_specified , M_depress L_morale and L_motivation but they will not in themselves L_result in very M_high M_levels of these L_parameters ."
clp-fragment01,795,L_Morale and L_motivation are L_influenced more by L_conditions of L_work in the L_sense of L_work L_variety L_opportunities and M_attitudes of L_management .
clp-fragment01,796,These L_factors are L_worthy of M_emphasis because in L_practice they are L_still M_dealt with very L_badly in L_many L_organisations and L_yet it M_takes L_little L_trouble or L_expertise to M_make an L_enormous L_difference .
clp-fragment01,797,"for L_example , very few M_senior L_managements M_take the L_trouble to M_keep L_workers L_fully L_informed about L_policies and L_likely L_changes ."
clp-fragment01,798,The L_result is L_excessive L_reliance on L_rumour and M_continuous L_speculation which is not only L_time-consuming but is L_also L_highly L_deleterious in L_morale L_terms .
clp-fragment01,799,The two L_human L_factors which can be L_unambiguously M_measured are L_age and L_sex .
clp-fragment01,800,The L_age M_distribution of a L_work L_force is L_always an L_interesting and L_important M_source of L_information .
clp-fragment01,801,For most L_purposes a M_rectangular M_distribution is the most L_desirable because it L_provides the L_appropriate M_mix of L_youthful L_enthusiasm and M_ageing L_experience .
clp-fragment01,802,It L_also M_makes for L_regular L_changes as L_staff M_retire and are M_replaced .
clp-fragment01,803,"L_Many M_distributions M_show a M_peak in a L_particular L_age M_group L_mainly L_associated with L_taking on a M_large L_number of L_young L_people when the L_organisation was L_started or L_reorganised , this is not M_desirable because it M_leads to L_excessive L_competition for L_promotion at L_particular M_stages ."
clp-fragment01,804,"These L_comments are L_obviously most L_relevant for L_work L_forces where there is L_little L_tendency to L_move out , this is L_characteristic of a L_surprisingly M_large L_number of L_organisations in L_European L_countries and in L_Japan but L_much L_less so in the U.S.A."
clp-fragment01,805,M_Stable L_work L_forces have their L_advantages in L_terms of M_familiarity with the L_enterprise and its L_peculiar L_needs but they do L_result in L_problems if the M_market for the L_products is L_erratic or L_otherwise L_unpredictable .
clp-fragment01,806,"This is L_particularly so in M_high L_technology e.g. L_design and L_construction of L_ships , L_aircraft , L_power L_stations and L_chemical M_plant , where the L_product L_unit is L_large and L_expensive and the L_variety of L_required L_expertise is M_extensive ."
clp-fragment01,807,"Some M_peaks of L_demand can be M_dealt with by M_using L_consultants , but they L_tend to be L_expensive and do not L_always M_fit L_well with L_ill-defined but L_important L_factors such as the L_favoured L_style of the L_organisation ."
clp-fragment01,808,In L_well L_ordered L_systems it may be L_possible to L_calculate the M_length of L_in-house L_experience L_required to L_achieve the L_required M_level of L_expertise in L_particular L_topics and L_compare this with the L_lead L_time for L_particular L_product L_requirements .
clp-fragment01,809,L_Given L_time L_available to M_train L_new L_staff it is not L_necessary to M_keep more than a M_nucleus in that L_particular L_expertise .
clp-fragment01,810,"On the other M_hand , if there is L_usually L_insufficient L_notice of L_need it may be L_necessary to M_keep L_staff who have L_periods with M_little to do between L_projects ."
clp-fragment01,811,It is L_also L_desirable to have the L_possibility of M_shifting L_staff between L_design and L_operational L_duties .
clp-fragment01,812,"This not only L_provides M_flexibility in the L_use of L_man-power , it L_also L_improves L_communication ."
clp-fragment01,813,These L_real L_difficulties of L_man-power L_utilisation are such as to M_force L_many L_organisations to L_become M_larger and M_larger if they are to L_remain L_economic .
clp-fragment01,814,M_Size L_provides a M_cushion to the L_vicissitudes of M_markets but it L_creates other L_problems .
clp-fragment01,815,"For L_example , L_difficulties of L_communications and in L_particular , how to L_inculcate the M_feeling within each L_individual that he and his L_performance are L_important to the L_organisation ."
clp-fragment01,816,This is L_considered in more L_detail in L_Chapter 3 .
clp-fragment01,817,"L_Human M_resources should be L_fundamental to M_subjects such as L_ergonomics which are L_essentially M_people-centred but the L_concept L_remains L_procedurally L_undeveloped at any M_level from a L_continent through L_countries , L_regions and L_companies down to L_particular L_working L_systems ."
clp-fragment01,818,This is one L_reason why L_policy M_makers L_never L_seem to M_take M_account L_fully of the L_people L_affected by their L_decisions .
clp-fragment01,819,The M_design of L_procedures
clp-fragment01,820,The L_increased L_importance of L_standardised L_informational M_support for both L_machines and L_operators has M_led to the L_concept of L_procedures as a L_separate M_design L_issue within a L_system ( Fig. 1.30 ) .
clp-fragment01,821,L_Much of this L_information can be L_incorporated in L_computer L_programs but there is L_also a L_need for M_extensive L_printed L_paper for the L_use of the L_operator .
clp-fragment01,822,"This M_takes three L_main M_forms : L_checklists , L_routines and L_knowledge-texts ."
clp-fragment01,823,The L_terminology in this M_field is not L_standardised .
clp-fragment01,824,"L_Software might be M_restricted , as in this L_book , to L_computer L_programs but it is L_sometimes L_used as the L_generic L_term to M_include all M_sources of L_information ."
clp-fragment01,825,L_Procedures is L_sometimes L_used for what are here L_called L_routines and L_sometimes to L_indicate all the L_operator 's L_information M_support except L_software .
clp-fragment01,826,The M_situation is further M_confused when some but not all the L_operator L_information M_support is itself M_computer-based .
clp-fragment01,827,L_Sometimes the L_term L_firm-ware is L_used .
clp-fragment01,828,L_However whatever the L_terminology L_used there is a L_requirement for M_design L_effort .
clp-fragment01,829,The L_quality of L_procedures would be L_much L_improved if L_designers M_followed some M_simple L_guide-lines ( L_Table 1.16 ) .
clp-fragment01,830,L_Many L_documents are L_written on the L_implicit L_assumption that the L_reader is L_much like the L_writer in L_terms of L_expertise and L_style of L_thinking .
clp-fragment01,831,L_Similarly it is M_assumed that the L_conditions under which the L_reading will M_take M_place are the same as those of L_writing which are L_usually a L_clean L_well-lit L_office .
clp-fragment01,832,"They may have to be L_read in the L_open L_air , in L_rain and L_darkness or within a M_plant under L_oily , L_cramped , L_poorly L_lit L_conditions ."
clp-fragment01,833,The L_user L_probably has L_limited L_expertise and he may be L_working under L_various M_stress L_conditions .
clp-fragment01,834,"The L_material on which the L_information is L_printed , the L_typeface L_used , the L_sequence , the M_structure and the L_format L_generally should M_reflect the L_conditions of L_use , ( L_Easterby and L_Zwaga , 1984 ) ."
clp-fragment01,835,All these M_things can be L_achieved if it is L_acknowledged that all L_procedures should a L_validated by L_users under the L_normal L_conditions of L_use .
clp-fragment01,836,L_Checklists
clp-fragment01,837,"L_Checklists are L_used in the L_pre-start L_mode , for L_routine L_maintenance and for L_fault-finding ."
clp-fragment01,838,They L_normally M_take the M_form of a L_series of L_questions or L_statements which the L_operator L_uses to M_guide and L_structure his L_inspection of the L_hardware and other L_system L_components .
clp-fragment01,839,"The L_sequence is M_dictated by the L_optimal L_order in which L_actions should be M_taken , for L_example in L_starting up an L_aircraft ."
clp-fragment01,840,"There are L_many M_situations when the L_order is of no M_great L_consequence , for L_example a L_safety L_audit of a L_new L_machine , and in this L_latter L_case some L_logical M_structure is L_needed ."
clp-fragment01,841,"As M_mentioned above , the L_logic of the M_design may not be the L_optimal L_basis if the M_way the L_operator L_thinks and L_acts is L_different ."
clp-fragment01,842,L_Baker ( 1984 ) L_suggests that four L_kinds of L_shortcoming M_emerge when L_checklists are L_validated in the L_real M_situation .
clp-fragment01,843,The L_operator may L_deviate from the L_listed L_procedure because it may L_require L_excessive L_moving about or because he is L_interrupted by the L_requirements of other L_tasks .
clp-fragment01,844,"L_Systematic L_use of a L_checklist L_often M_reveals L_faults in L_work M_design such as L_inadequate M_access , L_visibility and L_labelling ."
clp-fragment01,845,"The L_checklist itself may be L_inconsistent , L_incomplete , L_imprecise or L_ambiguous ."
clp-fragment01,846,"L_Finally the L_checklist may have L_reprographic L_limitations such as L_inadequate M_vertical or M_horizontal M_structure , M_poor L_typefaces and L_insufficient M_linking of L_requirements , L_descriptions , L_remarks and L_tick-off M_points ."
clp-fragment01,847,The L_International L_Ergonomics L_Association L_developed a L_general L_ergonomics L_checklist which is M_reproduced in L_Edholm ( 1967 ) .
clp-fragment01,848,There is a L_deceptive L_simplicity about such L_lists which L_requires M_extensive L_effort to L_ensure a L_comprehensive but L_coherent M_content .
clp-fragment01,849,"The M_context is , of L_course , the M_context of L_ergonomics as M_conceived by the L_designers of the L_list ."
clp-fragment01,850,L_Routines
clp-fragment01,851,A L_routine is the most L_common M_form of L_instructional M_material .
clp-fragment01,852,"The L_reader is L_required to M_follow a L_series of M_steps which might , for L_example , M_introduce a L_change in the M_performance of a L_complex L_system ."
clp-fragment01,853,L_Normally L_routines are L_single M_chains of L_instructions although it is L_possible to have some L_conditional M_branching .
clp-fragment01,854,"Each M_step should be M_simple and L_complete in itself — L_preferably with some L_indication that L_successful L_completion has been L_achieved , for L_example the L_appearance or the L_change of L_colour of a L_signal L_light , or the L_noise of a L_motor L_starting or a L_change of L_pressure which L_indicates that there has been a L_change in the M_flow of some L_material ."
clp-fragment01,855,As L_mentioned L_earlier a L_routine can L_often be M_regarded as a L_written L_task L_description .
clp-fragment01,856,By L_definition and M_design L_intention L_routines are M_inflexible .
clp-fragment01,857,The L_user is L_intended to L_behave L_exactly L_according to their L_instruction .
clp-fragment01,858,"No M_great L_skill or L_intellectual L_effort is L_required , which is one M_way of M_saying that the L_human L_operator is being M_under-used , but the L_purpose of a L_routine is L_usually to M_avoid L_common L_human L_error such as L_omitting a M_step or M_reversing M_steps ."
clp-fragment01,859,"In L_general the L_value of M_formal L_routines is L_precisely that the L_operator , M_left to himself , will not L_normally L_function in such a L_systematic L_sequential L_manner ."
clp-fragment01,860,L_Knowledge L_texts
clp-fragment01,861,L_Knowledge is M_contained in L_documents which may L_vary from L_single L_sheet L_presentations to M_large L_manuals .
clp-fragment01,862,"As L_instructional M_material it is M_indirect in that the L_reader is not L_necessarily M_told what to do , as in a L_routine ."
clp-fragment01,863,L_Rather he is L_informed about the M_situation and the L_purpose of L_informing him is to L_provide a L_knowledge M_base from which he can L_work out his own L_actions .
clp-fragment01,864,"L_Nevertheless , the L_relevant L_action L_remains L_important and the L_knowledge L_provided should be L_carefully and L_stringently L_selected ."
clp-fragment01,865,It is too L_easy to M_follow the L_academic L_tradition and L_provide L_knowledge for its own L_sake .
clp-fragment01,866,"The ‘ L_need to L_know ’ L_criterion is L_crucial because unless it is M_applied , the L_operator can be L_overburdened with L_unnecessary M_material ."
clp-fragment01,867,L_Correspondingly the M_material should be L_structured in L_terms of how it is most L_likely to be L_used .
clp-fragment01,868,In this M_context the L_operator L_requires a M_guide for L_action and not a L_scientific L_text-book .
clp-fragment01,869,"It is L_invariably L_better to L_provide M_material L_diagrammatically , L_systematically or at L_least in L_well-structured M_short L_paragraphs L_rather than in M_flowing L_prose ."
clp-fragment01,870,M_Consider for L_example how L_readily L_information about the L_relative L_position of L_streets is L_available from a L_map of a L_town M_centre L_rather than a L_verbal L_description of all the L_streets .
clp-fragment01,871,Such a L_map will L_enable the L_reader to L_work out for himself how to L_get from one L_location to another within the L_town .
clp-fragment01,872,M_Note the M_enormous M_flexibility L_compared with a L_routine which would M_tell him only how to L_get from one L_particular M_point to another .
clp-fragment01,873,"A L_second L_important L_difference is that if he L_misses his L_place in a L_routine he will be L_totally M_lost , whereas if he L_happens to L_go in the L_wrong L_direction while L_using a L_map he is L_still L_able to M_make whatever M_correction is L_necessary ."
clp-fragment01,874,L_However the L_map does L_require more L_intellectual L_effort than does the L_routine not only in M_making L_decisions about how to M_proceed but L_also in M_filtering out the L_required L_information from the M_massive L_irrelevance ( for a L_particular L_task ) which is L_equally L_available .
clp-fragment01,875,"L_Thus , one would L_expect the L_use of the L_maps to be L_slower than the L_use of L_routines with the L_human L_performance being more L_versatile but L_less L_predictable ."
clp-fragment01,876,With L_two-dimensional L_representations such as L_maps it L_remains L_important to M_avoid too L_much L_homogeneity and L_provide M_substructure in the M_form of L_main L_roads and L_key L_buildings or other M_features such as L_rivers .
clp-fragment01,877,"L_See , for L_example , Fig. 5.3"
clp-fragment01,878,"L_Manuals which may M_contain L_maps , L_schematic L_diagrams and other M_materials M_warrant L_separate L_consideration ."
clp-fragment01,879,The M_design of L_manuals
clp-fragment01,880,A L_manual is L_usually in the M_form of a L_book or L_booklet which is L_sent with the L_hardware from the L_maker to the L_customer .
clp-fragment01,881,It is L_part of the L_communication L_package from the L_designer to the L_user .
clp-fragment01,882,L_Thus it is a L_particular M_form of L_job L_aid which L_provides the L_operator with L_information on a L_system and its L_performance .
clp-fragment01,883,The M_standard of L_manual M_design has L_traditionally been very M_low for L_several L_reasons .
clp-fragment01,884,"For this L_purpose , the L_designer is too L_familiar with the L_product and he L_rarely M_takes the L_trouble to L_find out what the L_user L_really L_needs to L_know ."
clp-fragment01,885,"L_Often the L_manual has to be L_provided L_hurriedly at the M_end of a L_project when the L_budget is M_running out , and it is M_regarded as a L_tiresome L_chore L_still L_required after the L_essential M_design L_work has been L_completed ."
clp-fragment01,886,The L_problem is L_particularly L_acute for L_computers .
clp-fragment01,887,"L_Manuals for L_cars , L_machine L_tools and so on are M_poor but at L_least it is L_possible to L_observe the L_mechanisms and their L_functions ."
clp-fragment01,888,"Most L_computer L_operators do not L_know or L_wish to L_know about the L_mechanisms , and in any L_case these are not M_accessible to L_vision and L_manipulation ."
clp-fragment01,889,"The L_computer L_operator is L_entirely L_dependent on the L_manual , at L_least in the L_early M_stages of L_gaining L_familiarity with the L_system and its L_functions ."
clp-fragment01,890,He is L_usually very L_badly M_served although the L_principles of L_manual M_design are L_well L_known .
clp-fragment01,891,For most L_systems the L_manual is L_best M_divided into M_parts as L_indicated in L_Table 1.17 .
clp-fragment01,892,"The L_first M_part should be a L_general M_introduction which L_orientates the L_readers towards the L_system , its L_purpose , its L_functional M_structure and L_mode of L_operation and its L_performance M_limits ."
clp-fragment01,893,This should be M_followed by a L_separate M_section on how to M_set the L_system up in the L_first M_place and how to L_check that it is M_working L_properly .
clp-fragment01,894,"If it is L_fairly L_small it may be L_necessary to L_describe how to L_unpack it , L_fix it into L_position , L_connect it to M_power L_supplies and L_start it up ."
clp-fragment01,895,"If it is L_large , the M_emphasis will be on the L_start up L_procedure ."
clp-fragment01,896,The M_section M_describing the L_operation of the L_system should M_cover not only how the L_system L_operates but L_also how the L_user can L_operate it .
clp-fragment01,897,"M_Extensive L_use of L_line L_drawings , L_schematic L_diagrams , L_algorithmic L_lists is M_desirable , and where L_prose is L_used this L_also should be L_structured into M_short L_sentences with L_meaningful L_separation into L_paragraphs ."
clp-fragment01,898,"The L_maintenance M_section should L_indicate what , if L_anything , the L_operator is L_expected to do and the M_symptoms which L_indicate that more L_specialist L_maintenance L_skills are L_required ."
clp-fragment01,899,L_Tables L_subdivided into Faults/Reasons/Remedies can be L_extremely L_helpful .
clp-fragment01,900,L_Parts L_lists M_including L_description L_reference L_numbers and L_sometimes L_drawings are L_necessary if the L_user is L_expected to M_deal with his own L_replacements .
clp-fragment01,901,A L_standard L_fault is to M_assume that the L_reader is L_familiar with the L_jargon which the L_designer L_habitually L_uses .
clp-fragment01,902,A L_glossary of L_terms and L_acronyms L_used can be very L_helpful not only to the L_reader but L_also to the L_writer who is M_forced to M_consider L_carefully how he is L_using L_various L_technical L_terms .
clp-fragment01,903,"L_Finally , all L_manuals should L_end with an L_index which L_supplements the L_table of M_contents at the L_beginning ."

crs-fragment01,5,"During the 1980s L_Margaret L_Boushel , L_Claire L_Debenham , L_Lisa L_Dresner and L_Anna L_Gorbach L_worked in the L_London L_borough of L_Islington within L_social L_services for L_pre-school L_children ."
crs-fragment01,6,This L_chapter is an M_account of the M_way they M_perceived L_attempts to L_develop L_integrated L_provision for under L_fives and the M_barriers in M_attitudes and M_systems which were M_encountered .
crs-fragment01,7,The L_first M_section M_provides an L_overview of L_provision and L_services in 1983 .
crs-fragment01,8,The L_next M_section M_describes L_attempts to L_create a M_clear under-fives L_policy .
crs-fragment01,9,The L_third M_section M_looks at the L_faltering L_progress towards L_integrated L_services .
crs-fragment01,10,"The L_fourth M_section M_examines the M_formidable M_barriers that were L_posed by L_reorganisation of L_social L_services , L_local L_authority M_cuts and the M_demise of the L_Inner L_London L_Education L_Authority ."
crs-fragment01,11,The L_chapter M_concludes with a M_mixture of L_resignation and L_determination .
crs-fragment01,12,"M_BACKGROUND : UNDER-FIVES L_SERVICES IN L_ISLINGTON , 1983"
crs-fragment01,13,"L_Islington is a L_multi-ethnic , L_inner L_city L_London L_borough with a L_child L_population of 29,000 ."
crs-fragment01,14,"In 1982 , 44 per L_cent of under L_fives in L_Islington had the L_use of an under-fives L_facility , 29 per L_cent on a L_full-time and 15 per L_cent on a L_part-time L_basis ."
crs-fragment01,15,"Between 1982 and 1988 L_provision L_gradually L_increased , so that by 1988 there were 12 L_children 's L_day L_centres , about 70 L_playgroups and 350 L_assisted L_child-minding L_places L_funded L_partially or L_totally by the L_Social L_Services L_Department , and 1,075 L_full-time and 824 L_part-time L_places in L_nursery L_schools L_funded by the L_Inner L_London L_Education L_Authority ."

crs-fragment01,17,"Unlike L_council L_day L_centres , L_playgroups or L_community L_nurseries , the L_Beacon L_Nursery was M_free ."
crs-fragment01,18,L_Children were L_collected from L_home by L_special L_bus and L_places were L_available on L_demand .
crs-fragment01,19,The L_Beacon had been in L_existence for L_many L_years and in the L_past had L_catered for up to thirty L_children with a M_wide M_range of L_disabilities and L_needs .
crs-fragment01,20,By 1983 it had half that L_number on M_roll .
crs-fragment01,21,Since 1983 L_numbers at the L_Beacon L_continued to M_fall as it was L_increasingly M_seen as a M_resource for L_children with L_severe and L_multiple L_disabilities .
crs-fragment01,22,"In L_addition the L_Elfreda L_Rathbone L_organisation , a L_voluntary L_organisation L_helping L_people with L_learning L_disabilities , M_ran a M_free L_day L_nursery in the L_borough for a M_small L_number of L_children with L_learning L_difficulties ."
crs-fragment01,23,"Some L_integrated L_services M_emerged in the L_early 1980s — one L_playscheme was L_developed through a L_parent 's L_initiative , and an L_integrated L_adventure L_playground was L_established by a L_voluntary L_organisation ."
crs-fragment01,24,L_Workers from the L_integrated L_playscheme L_subsequently M_supported a L_local L_special L_school in L_integrating under L_fives into a L_playgroup .
crs-fragment01,25,"In L_addition to its L_mainstream L_schools , the L_borough L_included five L_special L_schools L_providing L_primary and L_secondary L_education to L_children with L_special L_needs from L_Islington and L_neighbouring L_boroughs — one for L_children with L_moderate L_learning L_difficulties , one for L_children with L_severe L_learning L_difficulties , one for L_children with L_emotional and L_behavioural L_difficulties , one for L_autistic L_children , and one for L_children with L_physical L_disabilities ."
crs-fragment01,26,In 1983 three of these L_offered L_nursery L_places to L_children from the L_age of 2 .
crs-fragment01,27,"The L_children L_using all of these L_services L_came from a M_wide M_range of L_ethnic M_backgrounds , though L_rarely was this L_actively and L_positively M_reflected in the L_type of L_care L_provided or the L_ethnic M_background of their L_carers ."
crs-fragment01,28,L_Residential L_units
crs-fragment01,29,"By 1983 L_residential L_services were M_designed with ‘ L_care in the L_community ’ in L_mind , but most were L_based in L_specialist L_settings ."
crs-fragment01,30,"For L_example , L_Field L_End L_House had been L_open for three L_years as a L_specialist L_unit for L_children with L_learning L_difficulties , and was M_designed to L_offer L_respite ‘ L_round the L_clock ’ L_care ."
crs-fragment01,31,L_Parents had M_fought for this as a L_local M_resource to L_prevent the L_need for L_children to be L_placed in L_long-stay L_placements L_far from L_home .
crs-fragment01,32,By 1988 L_Field L_End had been L_joined by another L_specialist L_children 's L_respite L_care L_unit at L_Leigh L_Road .
crs-fragment01,33,"The L_Social L_Services L_Department L_also L_provided thirteen L_short-term and L_long-term L_residential L_units for L_children in L_care ( by 1988 their L_number had been M_reduced to L_eleven ) , L_none with L_wheelchair L_access and only one with any L_experience of L_caring for L_children with L_learning L_difficulties ."
crs-fragment01,34,The L_Community L_Health L_Team
crs-fragment01,35,The L_Community L_Health L_Team had L_major L_responsibility for L_assessing L_children and L_recommending L_provision .
crs-fragment01,36,"It L_included L_physiotherapists , L_occupational and L_speech L_therapists , L_doctors , L_psychologists and a L_specialist L_health L_visitor ."
crs-fragment01,37,"They were L_joined in the M_network by L_specialist L_teachers , L_funded by the L_ILEA and L_based in the L_special L_schools , who L_visited L_children at L_home before they were L_due to L_start L_school ."
crs-fragment01,38,This L_group of L_people L_met on a L_regular L_basis to M_coordinate L_services and L_discuss L_professional L_issues .
crs-fragment01,39,L_Discussion of L_services to L_individual L_children L_also M_took M_place .
crs-fragment01,40,"This L_included L_deciding between L_day L_care or L_school , and L_parents ' M_attitudes to L_different L_options ."
crs-fragment01,41,L_Often a M_member of the L_group was L_delegated to L_advise L_parents on a M_course of L_action .
crs-fragment01,42,"The L_Community L_Health L_Team M_aim was to L_ensure a L_place of L_treatment for L_children from the L_earliest L_possible L_age , to L_enable them to L_develop to their M_fullest L_potential ."
crs-fragment01,43,"They were , L_however , an L_all-White L_group , M_operating without L_directly L_involving L_parents and were L_generally L_committed to L_specialist L_care in the L_community ."
crs-fragment01,44,They M_gave M_support to the L_Beacon and L_Elfreda L_Rathbone L_nurseries and most L_members M_saw these L_settings as the L_best L_places to ‘ L_treat ’ L_children .
crs-fragment01,45,Because of their L_early M_contact with L_parents they L_often had L_considerable L_influence in M_steering L_parents towards L_specialist L_provision .
crs-fragment01,46,The L_Special L_Services L_Team
crs-fragment01,47,In the L_early 1980s L_social L_workers were L_funded L_jointly by the L_ILEA and L_Islington L_Social L_Services L_Department to L_work with L_children L_attending two L_special L_schools and two L_specialist L_units for ‘ L_partially L_hearing ’ L_children .
crs-fragment01,48,These L_social L_workers were L_based in the L_borough 's L_Special L_Services L_Team .
crs-fragment01,49,They all L_worked with some under L_fives L_attending the L_schools they M_covered .
crs-fragment01,50,They were L_aware of a L_number of L_pre-school L_children who did not have L_adequate M_access to M_resources or M_support when L_parents and L_professionals were L_becoming L_aware of the L_possible L_extent and L_implications of the L_disability .
crs-fragment01,51,When a L_vacancy M_arose within this L_group of L_social L_workers in 1983 it was L_decided to L_appoint L_someone L_specialising in L_work with under L_fives with L_special L_needs .
crs-fragment01,52,This might have had the L_effect of M_drawing L_families into the L_specialist M_system at an L_earlier M_stage .
crs-fragment01,53,"L_Instead , for a L_number of L_reasons , it L_proved to be a L_key M_step in the L_development of the L_debate about L_integration in L_Islington ."
crs-fragment01,54,"L_First , the L_post was not M_attached to any L_specialist L_institution ."
crs-fragment01,55,There was an L_expectation but not a L_contractual L_obligation that the L_postholder would L_work M_closely with the L_Beacon L_Nursery .
crs-fragment01,56,"L_Second , the L_worker had an L_alternative L_peer L_group of under-fives L_workers who were L_key L_figures in M_controlling M_access to all other under-fives L_facilities ."
crs-fragment01,57,"L_Third , the L_worker was L_committed to the L_idea that L_treatment of a L_medical or L_disabling L_condition should not M_take L_precedence over the L_child 's L_social , L_emotional and L_cultural L_needs ."
crs-fragment01,58,There was now a L_new L_worker in the M_network who L_also M_made an L_early L_relationship with L_families but who could L_present a M_broader L_choice of L_day L_care to L_parents .
crs-fragment01,59,L_ATTEMPTING AN L_INTEGRATION L_POLICY
crs-fragment01,60,"The L_Labour L_Council , L_elected in 1982 , had as a L_stated L_policy M_aim that every L_child whose L_parents so L_wished was L_entitled to a L_pre-school L_place of some L_sort ."
crs-fragment01,61,This M_led to the L_initiation of an under-fives L_review .
crs-fragment01,62,"The L_review L_team , M_set up under the L_auspices of the L_Social L_Services L_Committee , L_included L_councillors , L_senior L_departmental L_management and L_representatives of the L_children 's L_day L_centre L_organisers and under-fives L_social L_workers in its L_membership ."
crs-fragment01,63,It L_proposed a M_network of under-fives L_centres throughout the L_borough — an L_idea which the under-fives L_workers had been L_anxious to L_promote for some L_time .
crs-fragment01,64,"L_Day L_care in each L_area would be L_organised and M_coordinated through the L_children 's L_day L_centres which would L_also L_provide L_information , M_support and M_resources to L_parents ."
crs-fragment01,65,The L_review had M_made no L_mention of L_children with L_special L_needs .
crs-fragment01,66,The L_specialist L_social L_worker and another under-fives L_worker with a L_personal L_interest in the L_issues L_undertook a L_supplementary L_review to L_examine M_resources for these L_children .
crs-fragment01,67,"They L_interviewed L_parents , L_specialist L_professionals and L_mainstream L_day-care L_workers and they M_designed a L_questionnaire which was L_completed by L_workers in a L_large L_proportion of L_mainstream L_council L_services and L_voluntary L_organisations , as L_well as by some L_child-minders ."
crs-fragment01,68,"L_Broadly , the L_survey M_confirmed that L_parents of L_children with L_special L_needs had not been M_given a L_real L_choice of L_placement , and that they had to M_fight M_hard for L_mainstream L_provision if this was their L_choice ."
crs-fragment01,69,L_Parents L_wanted to be M_part of the L_decision-making and did not M_feel that they were .
crs-fragment01,70,L_Many L_commented on L_lack of L_information about the M_range of L_facilities on L_offer .
crs-fragment01,71,"One L_Afro-Caribbean L_woman L_described how she M_felt that she was L_never M_given a L_choice of L_provision for her L_son , and L_objected to being L_told he should be in a L_specialist L_nursery for his own L_good ."
crs-fragment01,72,She M_fought M_hard to M_get him a L_part-time L_playgroup L_place in the L_group his L_older L_brother L_attended .
crs-fragment01,73,Because the L_group had L_known her and her L_children for some L_time they L_agreed to ‘ have a M_go ’ and the L_placement M_went M_ahead .
crs-fragment01,74,She L_commented :
crs-fragment01,75,I had to M_fight every M_step of the M_way for this .
crs-fragment01,76,"No L_one L_told me about it , and no L_one L_wanted him to have it ."
crs-fragment01,77,I L_knew it was L_right for him — this is where he L_learnt to L_join in and be like other L_children .
crs-fragment01,78,It does n't L_matter that he 's not like them .
crs-fragment01,79,"I L_know what is L_right for my L_child , but I 'm not L_supposed to L_say ."
crs-fragment01,80,"L_Parents L_also L_wanted an L_increased L_availability of L_specialist ‘ L_therapy ’ L_time , but L_wanted it to be L_used in a more M_flexible M_way ."
crs-fragment01,81,Some L_parents were very M_worried that more L_integrated L_settings would M_lead to L_lack of L_attention for L_children with L_special L_needs .
crs-fragment01,82,"L_Definitions of ‘ L_special L_needs ’ L_varied M_widely in the L_questionnaire L_responses — some L_defining it as L_children with L_disabilities , some L_including L_children with L_behavioural and L_emotional L_problems and some L_including L_children whose L_first L_language was not L_English ."
crs-fragment01,83,This M_made the L_survey L_difficult to L_interpret .
crs-fragment01,84,"The L_findings were L_documented in a L_report A L_Place For All Our L_Children ( L_CCUF 1983 ) and an L_analysis was L_prepared of the L_practical and L_bureaucratic L_problems in L_gaining an L_ordinary L_childcare L_place for a L_child with L_special L_needs , with L_suggestions for how these might be L_overcome ."
crs-fragment01,85,"These L_ideas were M_informed by a L_paper which had L_already been M_produced by an L_active M_member of the L_local L_Mencap L_group , who had L_previously L_tried to M_generate the L_debate within the L_Community L_Health L_Service through the L_Mencap L_committee ."
crs-fragment01,86,The L_conference : ‘ A L_place for all our children'
crs-fragment01,87,"As a L_result of this L_work the L_Coordinating L_Committee for Under L_Fives ( L_CCUF ) , an L_umbrella L_organisation of L_statutory and L_voluntary L_sector L_groups and L_individuals L_providing a L_service to under L_fives , L_decided to L_organise a L_conference to M_look at the L_issues of L_integration of L_special L_needs L_children within L_mainstream L_provision ."
crs-fragment01,88,L_Prior to the L_conference L_various L_groups L_met to M_produce L_short L_contributions to the L_debate .
crs-fragment01,89,"These L_included L_parents , under-fives L_workers , L_specialist L_workers , L_children 's L_day L_centre L_organisers and L_playgroups L_organisers ."
crs-fragment01,90,Each of these L_groups M_came up with a L_list of L_proposals which were L_sent to L_everyone L_attending .
crs-fragment01,91,"About 230 L_people L_attended the L_conference , M_held in L_April 1985 ."
crs-fragment01,92,"L_Workshops L_facilitated by the L_speakers and the L_conference L_organising L_group L_examined L_integration L_policies , L_overcoming L_practical L_problems for L_children in L_integrated L_provision and L_available M_sources of L_information ."
crs-fragment01,93,The L_conference M_made the L_following L_recommendations :
crs-fragment01,94,1
crs-fragment01,95,"For a L_formal , L_universal L_information M_system , M_covering L_local and L_specialist M_resources ."
crs-fragment01,96,2
crs-fragment01,97,For L_children 's L_needs to be M_considered with L_parents and their L_wishes L_acknowledged and L_recognised .
crs-fragment01,98,3
crs-fragment01,99,"For L_employment of L_extra L_staff where L_needed , and L_employment of L_peripatetic L_special L_needs L_workers ."
crs-fragment01,100,4
crs-fragment01,101,"For L_availability of L_money for L_equipment , L_toys and L_adaptations ."
crs-fragment01,102,5
crs-fragment01,103,For L_enhanced L_payments to L_child-minders L_caring for L_children with L_special L_needs .
crs-fragment01,104,6
crs-fragment01,105,For L_priority L_status for L_children with L_special L_needs in L_order to L_facilitate M_access to L_ordinary L_provision .
crs-fragment01,106,7
crs-fragment01,107,"For L_training L_facilities for L_staff in L_ordinary L_provision , L_specialist L_provision and L_child-minders ."
crs-fragment01,108,8
crs-fragment01,109,For M_greater L_communication and L_sharing of M_resources between L_ordinary and L_specialist L_provision .
crs-fragment01,110,9
crs-fragment01,111,"For L_therapeutic and L_professional L_staff to M_reflect the L_cultural M_backgrounds of the L_children , and that for all L_children , L_including those with L_special L_needs , their L_day-care M_environment and L_activities to M_express a M_consciousness of the L_multicultural L_society in L_Islington ."
crs-fragment01,112,"It was M_made M_clear that all of the above M_areas L_needed L_funding from L_health , L_education and L_social L_services before they could be L_implemented ."
crs-fragment01,113,"L_Finally , it was M_felt that unless the M_attitudes of L_advisers and L_information-givers L_became more L_positive towards L_integration , L_none of the L_recommendations could be L_effective ."
ea7-fragment03,790,( d ) L_Warfare and L_crusades
ea7-fragment03,791,The L_poet L_Marbod of L_Rennes M_celebrated ( in L_Latin ) the L_vengeance which would L_befall a L_wicked L_castellan and his L_troops :
ea7-fragment03,792,"The L_poem M_highlights two L_important L_twelfth-century L_developments : the L_use of M_force in M_punishing L_aristocratic L_crime ( the M_fruit of L_princely L_peace-keeping ) , and the M_increasing L_significance of L_siege-engines in L_warfare ."
ea7-fragment03,793,"L_Intellectuals L_claimed a L_formative L_influence in the L_second too : L_John of L_Marmoutier L_declared that L_monks from his own L_monastery had L_read L_Vegetius ' L_De L_Re L_Militari to L_Geoffrey le L_Bel when he was L_investing the L_castle of a L_rebellious L_castellan , and L_ascribed his L_success to their L_advice on L_firebombs ."
ea7-fragment03,794,"But L_common L_sense may have been more L_important than L_learning in L_perceiving the M_vulnerability of most L_castles to — L_battering-rams and L_catapults ; for L_even in 1100 they were , as a L_rule , L_primitive L_structures ."
ea7-fragment03,795,"L_Siege-engines M_demanded on the one M_hand L_skilled L_operators , and on the other a L_plentiful L_supply of L_unskilled L_labourers to L_move the L_necessary L_materials ."
ea7-fragment03,796,This L_effectively M_restricted their L_use to the L_wealthy and to those whose L_claim to L_assistance under the L_ban was L_incontrovertible .
ea7-fragment03,797,"L_Equally , the L_improvements in L_fortification L_needed to L_withstand their L_effects — L_thick L_stone L_walls , L_inner as L_well as outer L_defences — L_required L_incomes L_greater than those of L_simple L_lords ."
ea7-fragment03,798,"The M_net L_effect was that , L_given L_dedication , L_princes — L_Louis L_VI , L_Geoffrey le L_Bel , L_Alphonse-Jourdain — could L_subdue L_rebellious L_castellans within their own L_demesnes , and could L_build L_castles of their own which were L_impregnable to all but L_lengthy and L_sustained L_attack ."
ea7-fragment03,799,"L_Henry L_II 's L_castle at L_Chinon , where the L_treasury of L_Anjou was L_situated , was the L_model for its M_generation , with its L_halls , L_upper L_chambers , L_tower , and M_curtain L_walling , L_set on a L_high L_point above a L_strategic L_crossing of the L_Loire ."
ea7-fragment03,800,"It could be M_copied only either by those of L_nearly L_equal L_wealth or by those who could L_concentrate their L_resources L_chiefly on L_defence — L_princes , M_great L_bishops or , in the L_south L_especially , L_towns ."
ea7-fragment03,801,All L_others L_became L_vulnerable .
ea7-fragment03,802,L_John of L_Salisbury 's L_comment that not only the L_towns but L_also the L_fortresses of L_Gaul M_feared L_Henry I of L_England was M_revealing of the L_new M_situation .
ea7-fragment03,803,"L_Similarly , L_campaigning in the L_field L_imposed an M_increasing L_financial M_burden ."
ea7-fragment03,804,"The L_treaty between L_Robert L_II of L_Flanders and L_Henry I of L_England , L_renewed by their L_successors , L_stipulated that each L_knight M_supplied to the L_English L_king should L_bring three L_horses with him — this at a L_time when a L_horse L_represented a L_major L_investment ."
ea7-fragment03,805,Then L_knightly L_armour M_grew more L_elaborate and L_costly throughout the L_century .
ea7-fragment03,806,"And though some L_knights might be L_supplied M_free by L_feudal L_service , L_household L_ones had to be M_maintained by their L_lords , L_mercenary L_ones L_needed L_pay , and those with L_money-fiefs L_constituted a L_regular M_charge on the L_treasury ."
ea7-fragment03,807,"Besides , L_away from their L_home L_base , L_knights were L_useless on their own ."
ea7-fragment03,808,"In M_open L_battle and in the L_plundering L_expeditions that L_constituted the L_normal M_form of L_aggressive L_warfare , they L_needed the M_backing of L_archers , both L_mounted and on L_foot , and of L_numerous L_infantrymen ."
ea7-fragment03,809,"The L_usual M_source of L_supply was L_town L_militias — L_Suger L_mentions those of L_Rheims , Châlons , L_Laon , L_Soissons , Orléans , L_Etampes , and L_Paris in the L_royal L_army of 1124 ."
ea7-fragment03,810,"But they might have to be L_supplemented by L_mercenaries from L_Flanders and the L_Low L_Countries , where the L_rapidly M_expanding L_population M_forced M_large L_numbers of L_young L_men into L_military L_careers ."
ea7-fragment03,811,"In the M_eyes of the L_faithful , these ‘ L_Brabanters ’ , with their L_freebooting and L_lack of L_discipline after the M_end of L_campaigns , were as L_dangerous as L_heretics ; in 1171 L_Frederick L_Barbarossa and L_Louis L_VII L_agreed to L_expel them from their L_lands ."
ea7-fragment03,812,"Their M_value in L_battle , as M_shields behind which the L_knights could M_shelter before they M_launched their M_charge , L_ensured their L_continued L_employment by those who could L_afford them — L_notably L_Henry L_II of L_England ."
ea7-fragment03,813,But the L_hatred they L_aroused M_meant that they were M_liable to be L_brutally L_slaughtered if L_captured L_afterwards .
ea7-fragment03,814,"L_Inevitably , L_therefore , L_war on the L_grand M_scale as L_fought by L_princes M_bore L_little L_resemblance in L_practice to the L_feuds of L_lesser L_men ."
ea7-fragment03,815,"The L_divergence was M_sharpened by the M_application of a L_theoretical L_distinction , the M_fruit of L_Augustinian L_theology , M_amplified as the L_century L_went on by L_canon and L_Roman L_law L_reference ; L_princes L_pronounced their L_campaigns just L_wars ( L_fought against L_aggressors with the M_aim of L_re-establishing L_peace ) or L_public L_wars ( L_declared by a L_competent L_authority in the L_public L_interest ) , while they L_condemned the L_wars of L_lesser L_men as L_infractions of the L_peace ."
ea7-fragment03,816,"L_Geoffrey L_Martel had M_perceived the L_propaganda L_potential of L_public L_war as L_early as the L_mid L_eleventh L_century ; L_later it L_enabled L_Henry the L_Liberal of L_Champagne to L_claim the L_military M_service of all L_lords within his L_county , a M_reapplication of the L_Carolingian L_ban ."
ea7-fragment03,817,So it could be a L_powerful M_weapon .
ea7-fragment03,818,"L_Yet the L_logic of the L_definition M_suggested that it would L_benefit L_especially L_kings , whose L_competence to L_declare L_war could not be L_impugned : L_thus L_Thibaud of L_Blois L_failed to L_persuade the L_monks of L_Marmoutier that they L_owed him M_service when he L_fought against L_Louis L_VI ; they L_claimed L_discretion in the L_matter ; and in 1184 , the L_mighty L_Philip of L_Alsace L_hesitated to M_commit to L_battle the L_army he had L_summoned against L_Philip L_Augustus , through L_fear that its L_ranks might M_melt M_away ."
ea7-fragment03,819,The M_contrast with the M_united M_front L_Louis L_VI and his L_troops L_presented to the L_emperor L_Henry V in 1124 was L_marked .
ea7-fragment03,820,"A L_royal L_banner now M_bestowed L_respectability on a M_cause ; L_kings ' L_wars were M_assumed to be for the L_sake of L_peace , L_even when M_cripplingly L_expensive and L_increasingly L_savage ."
ea7-fragment03,821,"This M_goes some M_way to L_explaining why the M_complicated L_campaigns within L_Toulouse in the L_second M_half of the L_century were L_largely L_fought out under the L_banners of the L_Angevin , L_Aragonese , and L_French L_kings ; and why the L_revolts of L_Henry L_II 's L_sons had L_widespread L_ramifications ."
ea7-fragment03,822,"The L_twelfth L_century was L_characterized , L_therefore , by fewer but more L_protracted L_wars , which M_smouldered for M_long L_periods between M_short , M_sharp L_bouts of L_conflict , like the L_war that M_covered must of the L_reigns of L_Henry I of L_England and L_Louis L_VI of L_France , the L_one M_inaugurated by the M_great L_rebellion of 1173 , which M_outlived both L_Louis L_VII and L_Henry L_II , or that against L_Catalan L_claims in the L_south ."
ea7-fragment03,823,Into these M_large L_numbers of L_local L_conflicts were L_subsumed .
ea7-fragment03,824,"The M_pattern L_caused L_problems , in that the L_circumstances which might L_trigger off L_renewed L_fighting were L_unpredictable ; L_yet the L_moment an L_opportunity M_offered , L_princes had to be L_prepared for L_invading their L_enemies ; there was no L_time for L_lengthy L_preparation ."
ea7-fragment03,825,"The L_usual L_tactic was to L_march L_troops across the L_enemy 's L_territory , L_plundering and L_looting ; to M_take L_fortified L_places if the L_task was L_easy ; to L_obtain L_allies among the L_lords of the L_locality ; and to L_retreat without L_fighting a L_battle if at all L_possible — in L_effect an M_application to a M_wider M_canvas of the some L_technique of L_warfare which had L_earlier M_made L_castellans L_formidable in the L_immediate L_environs of their L_castles ."
ea7-fragment03,826,"It L_necessitated the L_rapid L_mobilization of L_auxiliaries to M_join a M_core of L_highly-trained L_troops L_kept L_constantly , at the L_ready — the L_princes ' L_military M_households , which L_became the L_linch L_pin of the M_system ."
ea7-fragment03,827,"L_John of L_Marmoutier 's L_life of L_Geoffrey le L_Bel M_offers a M_glimpse of how M_strong M_bonds were L_created between the L_prince and his L_followers within the M_household , and how a M_high M_level of L_training was M_maintained at all L_times ."
ea7-fragment03,828,"L_Geoffrey was L_brought up from L_infancy with the L_sons of L_neighbouring L_Angevin L_lords , on whose L_companionship he L_relied ."
ea7-fragment03,829,"When it M_came L_time for him to be L_knighted by L_Henry I in L_Rouen , he L_set off for L_Normandy with a L_crowd of these L_young L_men about him ."
ea7-fragment03,830,"In L_Rouen , the L_occasion was L_celebrated with L_pomp , L_elaborate L_dress , and a L_great L_feast , and then the L_youths all L_demonstrated their L_military L_skill at a L_grand L_tournament , at which L_Geoffrey M_naturally L_won the M_highest L_honours ."
ea7-fragment03,831,"It was within this L_kind of M_environment that L_chivalry M_flourished , that L_young L_men L_learned to L_identify , their L_vassalage towards their L_lord as a M_symbol of their L_honour , that they M_debated the L_relative L_merits of L_Roland 's and L_Oliver 's M_way of M_displaying L_loyalty ; and that they L_learned the M_finer M_points of L_jousting ."
ea7-fragment03,832,"L_Tournaments were L_disapproved of by L_ecclesiastics , for they could be both L_bloody and L_dangerous ."
ea7-fragment03,833,L_Yet they L_supplied L_real L_needs : .
ea7-fragment03,834,that of an L_instruction in the L_martial L_arts L_compatible with the M_maintenance of a L_prince 's L_peace ; that of an M_outlet for L_competitive L_instincts within the L_claustrophobic L_confines of a L_court ; and that of L_display to M_maintain L_princely L_social L_status .
ea7-fragment03,835,So they M_flourished L_everywhere .
ea7-fragment03,836,They M_offered L_opportunities for L_men of L_skill to L_acquire M_great M_position in the L_world — L_Arnoul of L_Ardres M_caught the M_eye of L_Countess L_Ida of L_Boulogne through his L_exploits ; and they L_also L_conferred M_lustre on the L_great — L_Geoffrey le L_Bel and L_Philip of L_Alsace were throughout L_France for their L_distinguished L_performances in these L_show L_battles .
ea7-fragment03,837,All this L_formed a M_background to the L_first L_century of L_crusading ; and it M_goes some M_way to L_explaining the more L_secular M_aspects of the M_magnetism which M_drew L_French L_knights to M_take up the M_cross in their L_thousands .
ea7-fragment03,838,"L_Urban L_II , M_launching the L_First L_Crusade at L_Clermont in 1095 , M_presented it as a L_natural L_evolution of the L_peace M_movement : L_warriors were to L_forget their L_petty L_feuds and L_squabbles in a M_campaign to M_promote the L_interests of L_Holy L_Church ."
ea7-fragment03,839,"The L_war , L_declared by one whose L_moral L_authority was L_unimpeachable , was to M_free the L_Eastern L_churches , to L_end L_Muslim M_guardianship of the L_holy L_places , to M_restore L_Jerusalem to its L_proper L_state ."
ea7-fragment03,840,"As L_princes M_saw it , it was a just L_war in the M_fullest M_sense of the M_term ; those who were L_slaughtered in its L_battles were M_regarded as among the L_martyrs of the L_church ."
ea7-fragment03,841,"When L_Raymond of L_Toulouse , L_Robert L_II of L_Flanders , L_Robert L_Curthose , L_Stephen of L_Blois , and L_Hugh of L_Vermandois M_responded to the M_call , L_past and L_present M_members of their L_military M_households M_fell L_almost M_automatically into L_rank behind them , to L_test themselves against L_terrible L_dangers , but L_also to L_enjoy the L_companionship in L_arms , the L_adventure , the L_deeds of L_daring which were the M_stuff of the L_chansons de L_geste ."
ea7-fragment03,842,"That they M_shared , along with all other L_participants in the L_crusade , a L_fervent L_devotion , a M_conviction that their L_sins would be L_forgiven , is L_certain ."
ea7-fragment03,843,"L_Yet for them L_crusading L_necessitated no M_large M_leap of the L_imagination , no L_millenarian M_vision ; it was L_simply a L_challenging and a L_deserving M_extension of their L_everyday L_activities ."
ea7-fragment03,844,"In L_French M_eyes , the L_hero of the L_First L_Crusade was L_Robert L_II of L_Flanders ."
ea7-fragment03,845,"While L_Raymond of L_Toulouse L_remained in L_Outremer , L_Stephen and L_Hugh L_disgraced themselves in L_escaping from the L_siege of L_Antioch , and L_Robert L_Curthose , no L_matter how L_gallant , at L_least in his L_lifetime L_failed to M_impress , L_Robert L_II 's L_prestige M_soared to the M_skies ."
ea7-fragment03,846,He L_became L_Robert of L_Jerusalem to his L_contemporaries ; his L_deeds were L_recorded in the L_Song of L_Antioch ; his L_pious L_bravery L_totally M_expunged the L_memory of L_Robert the L_Frisian 's L_usurpation ; and after his L_death his L_son L_Baldwin L_VII M_harped on his L_father 's L_achievement to L_justify his L_substantial L_use of L_coercion against the L_enemies of the L_church .
ea7-fragment03,847,"L_Outside L_Flanders , L_Robert 's L_sister 's L_marriage to L_Roger of L_Sicily was a M_mark of his L_new M_position in the L_world ; like L_Louis L_VI 's L_sister 's L_marriage to L_Bohemond of L_Antioch , it M_stretched L_French L_kinship M_connections into the L_new L_Norman L_colonies , L_ensuring that L_travellers from the L_homeland would M_find a L_welcome in those L_distant L_parts ."
ea7-fragment03,848,L_Robert 's L_example was a L_potent one .
ea7-fragment03,849,"After the L_next M_change in L_dynasty , L_Thierry and L_Philip of L_Alsace M_strengthened their M_shaky L_claim to the L_comital M_position by L_attaining for themselves the L_prestige M_attached to being the L_outstanding L_crusaders of their L_generation ."
ea7-fragment03,850,"L_Thierry 's M_remote M_connection with the L_family of L_Godfrey de L_Bouillon , along with his L_marriage with L_Sybilla of L_Anjou , L_Fulk V 's L_daughter , M_gave him some L_claim to the L_throne of L_Jerusalem ; as a L_consequence , the L_aristocracy of L_Outremer M_viewed him and L_Philip with M_mixed M_feelings , L_expecting L_much of them , L_yet L_fearing their L_ambitions ."
ea7-fragment03,851,"In the L_end , it was not in L_Outremer but in the L_newly L_conquered L_Byzantine L_empire that the L_Flemish L_crusading L_achievement was M_crowned with the M_elevation of L_Count L_Baldwin IX to the L_imperial L_throne in 1204 ."
ea7-fragment03,852,"But in the L_twelfth L_century , the L_house of L_Alsace could L_afford the M_high L_costs of their L_expeditions — L_Thierry L_went to L_Jerusalem four L_times , L_Philip L_twice — and the L_counts ' L_repeated L_absences in L_fact M_promoted L_administrative L_reform ; the L_baillis and the L_Grote L_Bref were as L_much the M_products of L_crusading as the L_English and L_Norman L_judicial M_system and L_exchequers were the M_product of the L_king-duke 's M_divided L_attentions ."
ea7-fragment03,853,"But if , on M_balance , the L_Flemish L_counts L_benefited L_materially from L_crusading , — as , L_arguably , did the L_Angevin — they were L_far from L_typical ."
ea7-fragment03,854,For other L_French L_houses a L_commitment to L_Outremer L_often L_represented a M_sacrifice of L_domestic L_political L_interest .
ea7-fragment03,855,"The L_achievements of L_Raymond L_IV L_St L_Gilles in L_consolidating his L_authority within L_Toulouse were M_threatened by his L_departure in 1095 , L_especially since it was L_known that he had no L_intention of L_returning L_home ."
ea7-fragment03,856,"Then his L_example M_lured his L_elder L_son L_Bertrand to L_Tripoli in 1112 , and his L_younger L_son L_Alphonse L_Jourdain there in 1147 ."
ea7-fragment03,857,"Had not his L_grandson L_Raymond V L_fulfilled his L_crusading L_obligation in his L_early L_youth , L_thereby M_freeing himself from the M_necessity of L_interrupting his L_career in the L_county , the L_principality of L_Toulouse might have M_disintegrated L_altogether ."
ea7-fragment03,858,L_William IX 's L_crusade of 1101 L_brought about M_serious L_financial L_problems in L_Aquitaine which L_caused L_rapid L_devaluation in the L_hitherto M_stable L_currency ; and L_Robert L_Curthose 's L_decision to L_mortgage L_Normandy to L_William L_Rufus in L_order to M_cover his L_crusading L_expenses L_exacerbated a L_conflict over the L_duchy which was not M_settled until the L_death of his L_son L_William L_Clito in 1128 .
ea7-fragment03,859,"All in all , it was not L_surprising that L_Suger , L_mulling over the L_precedents of L_early L_crusading , M_tried to L_dissuade L_Louis L_VII from M_embarking on his L_Jerusalem L_journey in 1145 ."
ea7-fragment03,860,"L_Yet the M_appeal of L_crusading was , if L_anything , L_even M_stronger to those L_aristocratic L_houses just below the M_level of the L_princely : it was , after all , the L_house of L_Boulogne which M_produced the L_first two L_rulers of L_Jerusalem ."
ea7-fragment03,861,"The L_counts of L_Nevers , the L_lords of L_Montpellier , the L_lords of L_Amboise and L_Lusignan , the L_Trencavels , were L_fervent L_devotees of the L_ideal ; so the L_problems of L_absences , L_shipwrecks , L_death L_abroad L_plagued them as L_much as their L_princes ."
ea7-fragment03,862,"On L_occasion , their M_determination to M_sacrifice for L_Christ M_played M_directly into their L_overlord 's M_hands , as when the L_count of L_La L_Marche , who had no M_direct L_heir , L_sold his L_county to L_King L_Henry L_II in 1177 ."
ea7-fragment03,863,"When it did not , L_accompanying their L_princes in a L_joint L_crusading L_venture , as the L_lord of L_Amboise L_accompanied L_Fulk V or L_Hugh L_VI de L_Lusignan L_William IX , L_created L_new L_personal M_links ."
ea7-fragment03,864,The L_political M_spin-offs from L_crusading are L_therefore more L_difficult to M_calculate than at L_first M_glance they might M_appear .
ea7-fragment03,865,L_Nevertheless it is M_clear that the M_chief L_gainer was L_Louis L_VII .
ea7-fragment03,866,"The L_irony of this M_lay in the L_fact that the L_Second L_Crusade was L_counter-productive in L_Outremer , L_embittered L_relations with L_Byzantium , and L_resulted in the L_deaths of M_enormous L_numbers of its L_participants , L_particularly those M_drawn from the non­aristocratic L_classes ."
ea7-fragment03,867,"L_Yet it L_consolidated the L_king 's M_position within L_France , L_partly through the L_skilled L_regency of L_Suger , but L_also because , in L_taking on himself the L_leadership of the L_expedition , L_Louis M_re-emerged as a L_credible L_ruler of L_men ."
ea7-fragment03,868,His L_noble M_gesture L_appeased those L_churchmen who had been L_appalled by his L_early L_obstinacy over the L_archbishopric of L_Bourges .
ea7-fragment03,869,The L_disasters that L_befell his L_army L_paradoxically L_heightened his L_personal L_charisma : L_even the L_barons of L_Outremer L_continued to M_look on him as their one L_potential L_saviour .
ea7-fragment03,870,"His L_friendship with L_Raymond V of L_Toulouse , a L_fellow L_warrior , M_reversed the L_trend of L_history since the M_middle of the L_tenth L_century , in M_bringing the L_princes of the L_far L_south M_back into the L_king 's L_mouvance ."
ea7-fragment03,871,"The L_crowds of L_Burgundians who L_accompanied the L_king L_learned to L_respect him ; on their L_return , they L_sought the L_arbitration of the L_royal L_court in their L_disputes , and they L_welcomed L_Louis 's L_intervention within the L_counties that L_fringed the L_duchy of L_Burgundy ."
ea7-fragment03,872,"As L_William of L_St L_Denis M_put it ,"
ea7-fragment03,873,L_Even as L_early as 1147 it was L_apparent that the L_crusading M_movement had L_provided a L_new M_sense of L_aristocratic L_cohesion in the L_realm .
ea7-fragment03,874,"The L_great L_joint L_expeditions , the L_combined L_leaderships , although not without M_friction , had been L_justified by their L_outstanding L_achievement , the L_conquest and L_maintenance of L_Jerusalem ."
ea7-fragment03,875,"They were the L_Gesta L_Francorum , the L_deeds of the L_Franks , or the L_Gesta L_Dei per L_Francos , L_God 's L_deeds L_performed through the L_Franks , as two of their L_earliest L_chroniclers L_entitled them ."
ea7-fragment03,876,But what was M_missing before 1147 was a M_clear M_sense of who the L_Franks were .
ea7-fragment03,877,"The L_Second L_Crusade , L_however , was M_launched with L_St L_Bernard 's M_ringing L_appeal to the L_count and L_barons of L_Brittany :"
ea7-fragment03,878,"In M_taking his L_place at the M_head of the L_Second L_Crusade , the L_Rex L_Francorum L_decisively L_hastened the L_transformation of the L_Franks into the L_French ."

ew1-fragment01,2,Few L_contemporaries would have L_expected L_Balfour 's L_retirement to M_lead to a L_Unionist M_recovery .
ew1-fragment01,3,The L_party was in a M_mutinous M_condition in L_November 1911 and there was no L_apparent L_successor who would have L_even half of L_Balfour 's L_political M_gifts .
ew1-fragment01,4,"Nor was it M_clear that L_Balfour 's M_departure was L_universally L_desired : at the L_National L_Union L_Conference a few L_days L_later , L_Leo L_Maxse was L_booed off the L_platform , and L_constituency L_parties L_everywhere M_passed L_resolutions M_regretting L_Balfour 's L_decision ."
ew1-fragment01,5,"A M_great L_many L_crocodile L_tears were M_shed , for , since L_Unionists had such an M_elevated M_view of the L_principle of L_leadership , they were L_unable to L_accept that they had just M_driven their own L_leader from L_office ."
ew1-fragment01,6,The M_shock L_caused by L_Balfour 's L_going L_thus did L_something to M_steady the L_party and it L_certainly M_produced a L_real L_determination to M_settle the L_affairs of the L_party with L_less M_friction than had been L_fashionable of L_late .
ew1-fragment01,7,"The L_main L_contenders for the L_leadership were L_Austen L_Chamberlain and L_Walter L_Long , L_representing the two L_different L_establishments of the L_Edwardian L_Unionist L_party — the M_opposite M_worlds of L_Birmingham and L_Wiltshire — but the M_situation was L_complicated by the L_intervention of two L_outsiders , L_Edward L_Carson and L_Andrew L_Bonar L_Law ."
ew1-fragment01,8,"Two M_strong M_groups M_emerged behind L_Long and L_Chamberlain , about L_equal in L_numbers , but there were few L_backers for L_Carson or L_Law ."
ew1-fragment01,9,"L_Carson L_thereupon M_fell out of the L_contest — or L_rather M_announced that he was not M_standing , for no L_official L_nominations had been M_made ."
ew1-fragment01,10,"The L_party L_officers and L_Whips were M_solidly behind L_Chamberlain , but L_Law M_drew off some of his M_support among L_tariff L_reformers and , L_urged on by L_Edward L_Goulding and L_Max L_Aitken , he L_refused to M_withdraw unless his L_continued L_candidature would M_allow L_Long to L_win ."
ew1-fragment01,11,"Against L_Chamberlain it was L_remembered that he was a L_Liberal L_Unionist ( as was L_Lansdowne , who M_led the L_Unionists in the L_Lords ) and that he had not been L_entirely L_loyal to L_Balfour since the L_referendum M_pledge ."
ew1-fragment01,12,L_Long was M_supported by the M_bulk of the L_English L_county M_members but by few of the L_party 's L_men of L_talent .
ew1-fragment01,13,By the L_morning of L_Friday 10 L_November it was M_clear that neither L_Chamberlain nor L_Long would M_secure a L_majority and that some L_supporters of each of them would not L_contentedly M_follow the other .
ew1-fragment01,14,A L_party L_meeting was to be M_held on the M_following L_Monday and the L_Whips were M_making L_preparation for a L_vote to be M_taken .
ew1-fragment01,15,L_Chamberlain L_provided the M_way out by L_suggesting to L_Balcarres that both he and L_Long should M_withdraw and so L_allow L_Law to be L_elected L_unanimously ; he L_also M_turned down L_Balcarres 's L_remarkable L_advice that he should L_allow L_Long to be L_elected since L_Long would M_make such a M_mess of M_things that L_Chamberlain would be M_bound to L_succeed within the L_year .

ew1-fragment01,19,The L_Carlton L_meeting on L_Monday M_went off L_quite L_admirably .
ew1-fragment01,20,L_Harry L_Chaplin in the L_chair a very M_great L_success .
ew1-fragment01,21,A L_good L_many L_men L_came into the L_room by no L_means M_inclined to L_acquiesce in the L_proposed M_arrangement .
ew1-fragment01,22,L_Walter L_Long L_proposed L_Bonar L_Law .
ew1-fragment01,23,His L_speech was one of the L_best M_things I have L_heard .
ew1-fragment01,24,Manly and L_rather L_touching .
ew1-fragment01,25,The L_country L_gentleman at his L_best .
ew1-fragment01,26,He L_spoke and L_evidently M_felt M_strongly of the L_degradation that it would have been to the L_parry to have L_elected a L_leader by L_secret L_ballot .
ew1-fragment01,27,L_Austen M_followed .
ew1-fragment01,28,When L_Austen L_sat down L_Chaplin L_suggested that he had L_better M_put the L_question at once and on M_getting an L_affirmative L_shout did so .
ew1-fragment01,29,A M_clever M_way of M_stifling L_discussion and few could have done it so L_well .
ew1-fragment01,30,Motion M_carried L_unanimously .
ew1-fragment01,31,L_Bonar L_Law then L_sent for …
ew1-fragment01,32,His L_speech M_struck me as the M_feeblest of the L_day .
ew1-fragment01,33,He was L_evidently M_moved and L_nervous .
ew1-fragment01,34,The L_meeting M_separated in M_great L_content with the L_Conservative L_Party all M_round .
ew1-fragment01,35,It was L_certainly L_creditable .
ew1-fragment01,36,The L_urgency of the L_events M_following L_Balfour 's L_resignation was L_due to the L_need to L_find a L_new L_leader before the L_National L_Union L_Conference .
ew1-fragment01,37,"So within a few L_days of his L_grudging L_acceptance by his L_parliamentary L_colleagues , L_Law 's L_leadership was M_ratified by the L_throng of L_party L_notables at L_Leeds ; here he L_received a L_reception more L_typical of what was to M_come in the L_future ."
ew1-fragment01,38,In 1911 L_Law was L_known — in so L_far as he was L_known at all in the L_parliamentary L_party — as a L_spirited L_debater .
ew1-fragment01,39,A. ) .
ew1-fragment01,40,"P. L_Taylor has M_noted that L_Law was M_trained , if he was M_trained for L_anything in his L_early L_career , to be a L_debater ."
ew1-fragment01,41,"In L_Glasgow he had M_picked up L_many of the L_skills that a more L_highly-born L_politician might have M_acquired in the L_Oxford L_Union or at the L_Bar , but L_skills that were very L_different in M_appearance ."
ew1-fragment01,42,His L_concern was L_solely with L_effectiveness L_rather than L_style ; he L_rarely L_spoke with more than M_brief L_notes and M_left it to the L_occasion to M_furnish the L_words .
ew1-fragment01,43,"( When he L_became L_Chancellor of the L_Exchequer this L_practice L_caused L_consternation at the L_Treasury , when he L_used only a L_page of L_notes to M_assist him in M_moving M_complicated L_resolutions on L_wartime L_finance ; he L_relied L_successfully on his L_memory to L_provide M_details and L_figures . )"
ew1-fragment01,44,As an L_extempore L_speaker he was L_able to L_tailor his L_words to his L_audience 's M_reactions and so M_convey the M_impression of L_personal L_conversation L_even when L_addressing L_thousands .
ew1-fragment01,45,"In L_parliament he was wont to M_abandon an L_argument L_half-completed if he L_sensed that his M_point had been M_made ; the L_speeches that M_appear in L_Hansard were M_touched up by his L_staff , and his L_speeches in the L_country were L_given to the L_press in M_advance ."
ew1-fragment01,46,"In L_debate he was a L_formidable L_opponent , and one that L_Asquith was L_never L_able to L_master , for all his L_forensic L_skills ."
ew1-fragment01,47,Again L_Law L_succeeded by L_unorthodoxy ; he was M_quick to M_grasp the M_essentials of an L_opponent 's L_argument and L_quite L_prepared to be M_rude or M_direct if the M_situation M_demanded it .
ew1-fragment01,48,"In the M_long L_debates over L_Marconi in 1913 and over the L_Curragh "" L_mutiny "" in 1914 L_Law was L_able to M_nail L_Asquith 's L_evasions where a more M_polished L_stylist might have been L_foiled ."
ew1-fragment01,49,"L_Occasionally , in the M_onrush of M_pursuit , he M_gave L_commitments that were L_later L_regretted , but these were a M_small M_price to M_pay ."
ew1-fragment01,50,"The L_Unionist M_recovery was M_built around L_Law 's L_leadership , but what L_Asquith L_called the "" M_new L_style "" of M_obstruction , L_threats and M_offensive L_behaviour did not L_originate with L_Law ."
ew1-fragment01,51,The L_beginnings are to be M_found in the L_diehard M_campaign against the L_Parliament L_Bill .
ew1-fragment01,52,"It was in L_June 1911 that the L_first M_scenes of L_disorder were M_mounted in the L_House of L_Commons , M_led by L_Lord L_Hugh L_Cecil ."
ew1-fragment01,53,"In L_August 1911 the L_diehard L_peers L_used L_language as M_violent as any that L_Law was to L_use L_later , and in the L_crucial L_decision on the L_House of L_Lords L_Law L_sided with the L_hedgers L_rather than the M_ditchers ."
ew1-fragment01,54,L_Ulster 's L_opposition to L_Home L_Rule L_long L_pre-dated L_Law 's L_leadership and he had L_rarely L_even L_spoken on L_Irish L_affairs in L_parliament before L_becoming L_leader .
ew1-fragment01,55,"Before he L_succeeded L_Balfour then , L_Law was not L_associated with any of the M_features that were to M_characterize his L_party L_leadership ; his M_contribution was to L_use the L_leadership in the M_service of all of these L_causes , to M_make himself the L_spokesman for the most M_spirited M_sections of the L_party ."
ew1-fragment01,56,L_Law L_conceived of the M_role of the L_leader in an L_exactly M_opposite M_sense from L_Balfour : he M_sought to M_foster L_unity by M_placing himself at the M_head of the M_discordant M_elements where L_Balfour had M_thrown the L_leadership on the M_side of M_restraint .
ew1-fragment01,57,"Their L_respective M_positions M_explain this in L_part : as L_ex-Prime L_Minister and a L_considerable L_figure in his own L_right , L_Balfour had the L_confidence to L_believe in his own L_judgement L_even when M_isolated from the M_bulk of the L_party ; as the L_tertium L_quid in the L_recent L_contest , L_Law had neither the M_weight nor the L_confidence to M_take such a M_detached M_view ."
ew1-fragment01,58,"His M_strategy was L_rather to M_canalize the L_enthusiasm of the L_diehards into L_party M_channels , to M_articulate their M_views , and to L_create L_unity from the M_sense of M_movement ."
ew1-fragment01,59,"In his L_characteristic L_phrase , "" I am their L_leader , I must M_follow them "" — but he L_determined to M_follow them from the M_front ."
ew1-fragment01,60,"As a L_result of this he was M_labelled as a L_diehard and a L_bigot , when he L_actually L_distrusted the L_diehards and was himself L_distrusted by the L_bigots ."
ew1-fragment01,61,"L_Much of his L_leadership was L_thus a M_form of L_pragmatic L_extremism , M_extreme M_action and the L_threat of more L_extreme M_action to M_come , but L_used in the L_cause of more L_limited L_objectives ."
ew1-fragment01,62,"He L_certainly M_held M_deep M_convictions as to the L_absolute L_wrongness of the L_Liberal L_policies that he L_opposed , but at L_least a M_part of his L_apparent M_hostility was M_assumed for the L_occasion , a M_hard M_line that might M_secure a L_better L_compromise in the M_end ."
ew1-fragment01,63,So in his L_first L_major L_speech as L_leader in L_parliament he L_wasted L_little L_time on the L_customary L_compliments and M_warned the L_government that he L_intended to M_play M_hard .
ew1-fragment01,64,"In L_private L_conversation he L_told L_Asquith "" I am L_afraid that I shall have to M_show myself very M_vicious L_Mr L_Asquith this L_session ."
ew1-fragment01,65,"I L_hope you will L_understand . """
ew1-fragment01,66,"In L_later L_conversations about L_Ulster , L_Law was L_frank L_enough to M_point out that L_bloodshed in L_Ulster would be the L_best M_way of L_ensuring an L_electoral M_landslide for the L_Unionists ."
ew1-fragment01,67,"There was then an M_open M_toughness about L_party M_tactics ; before the L_Buckingham L_Palace L_Conference in 1914 he had L_Central L_Office M_work out the L_electoral L_effects of M_excluding nine , six or four L_counties of L_Ulster from an L_independent L_Ireland the L_concern of a L_calculating L_pragmatist not of a L_bigot ."
ew1-fragment01,68,"From the L_party M_viewpoint L_Law 's L_methods were M_successful but M_dangerous ; L_expectations M_raised when the L_party was in M_full M_cry were not L_easily M_set M_aside for an L_eventual L_compromise , and the only L_outcome that would L_fully L_vindicate the L_methods was the M_recovery of M_power ."
ew1-fragment01,69,The L_basis of M_recovery was then L_Law 's M_fighting M_capacities as L_leader .
ew1-fragment01,70,In L_parliament there would be a L_carefully L_organized M_campaign of M_resistance that would at L_least M_slow the L_government down and M_raise L_Unionist L_morale .
ew1-fragment01,71,"L_Improved L_morale would L_also M_make L_possible L_organizational M_advances outside L_parliament , all M_linked to the L_issue of L_Ulster , and with the M_sights M_fixed M_firmly on the M_next L_election , an L_election that would M_make or M_break the L_Union , the L_Empire and L_Law 's L_leadership of the L_party ."
ew1-fragment01,72,"All was M_linked to the M_sense of a M_new M_departure , a "" M_new L_style "" , a "" M_new L_regime in L_politics "" and a L_new M_team at the M_helm : as L_well as a L_new L_leader , the L_party had by the M_middle of 1912 a L_new L_Chief L_Whip , L_Party L_Chairman , L_party L_treasurer , L_principal L_agent , L_press L_adviser , and an L_almost L_entirely L_new M_team of L_Whips and L_organizers ."
ew1-fragment01,73,L_Party L_organization L_provided the L_easiest M_advances because it was the only M_area L_entirely under the L_party 's M_control .
ew1-fragment01,74,"No L_general L_election was M_fought by the L_organization M_set up after 1911 , but there is L_little L_doubt that there was a M_massive L_improvement ; L_criticisms that were L_commonplace in 1910 were not to be M_heard by 1913 ."
ew1-fragment01,75,"The L_space L_available to L_Central L_Office was L_increased by the L_acquisition of L_St L_Stephen 's L_House as L_well as L_St L_Stephen 's L_Chambers , which had been L_occupied since 1874 ; the L_new L_office L_cost $3,000 a L_year in L_rent M_alone ."
ew1-fragment01,76,The L_quality of the M_senior L_staff was L_improved by the L_appointment of three L_specialists .
ew1-fragment01,77,"L_John L_Boraston L_took over as L_Principal L_Agent in 1912 , having been a L_professional L_organizer all his L_career and L_latterly L_chief L_agent to the L_Liberal L_Unionist L_Council ."
ew1-fragment01,78,"He M_joined L_William L_Jenkins , L_appointed L_chief L_organizing L_agent in 1911 and L_previously L_district L_agent for the L_Midlands L_Liberal L_Unionists ."
ew1-fragment01,79,The L_party was L_indeed M_handed over to L_Birmingham .
ew1-fragment01,80,"L_Finally , L_Malcolm L_Fraser , L_ex-editor of the L_Standard and of the L_Daily L_Express L_became L_first L_honorary L_press L_adviser and L_subsequently was L_employed to M_run the L_press L_bureau at the L_colossal L_salary of £1,200 ."
ew1-fragment01,81,"L_Steel-Maitland , L_Boraston , L_Jenkins and L_Fraser L_made up a M_team of L_experts , all of L_sufficient L_status to M_deal with L_politicians who might L_call into the L_office ; the M_work of the L_office was L_departmentalized for the L_first L_time and the M_heads of L_department M_brought M_together into a L_supervising L_board ."
ew1-fragment01,82,The L_influence of L_Central L_Office M_toned up the L_rest of the L_organization .
ew1-fragment01,83,A M_new L_canvass M_system was M_introduced in 1911 so that all L_county L_constituencies would M_operate the same M_system and so that L_duplicate L_records could be M_kept at M_area M_level .
ew1-fragment01,84,This was L_important at a L_time when L_outvoters were a L_larger M_group in L_many L_constituencies than the L_size of the L_majority and when the L_outvoters were L_overwhelmingly L_Unionist .
ew1-fragment01,85,"In 1914 a L_register of L_car L_owners was L_compiled , L_also L_important when some L_voters could M_cast L_several L_votes in an L_election when L_polling M_went L_several L_days ."
ew1-fragment01,86,"By L_November 1912 only fifty-one L_constituencies in L_Great L_Britain were without L_candidates , a L_much L_better M_position than the M_position at L_dissolution in either 1909 or 1910 ; few of these fifty-one L_constituencies were L_winnable , but in any L_case most of them had L_candidates by the M_end of 1913 ."
ew1-fragment01,87,"A L_programme of L_speakers for a L_general L_election was L_also M_ready by 1913 , with both L_constituencies and L_politicians L_told in M_advance what they might M_expect ."
ew1-fragment01,88,The L_financial L_mismanagement that had M_reigned before 1911 was L_ended with the L_employment of L_professional L_accountants .
ew1-fragment01,89,"L_Expenditure on L_Central L_Office , L_district L_offices and the L_London L_office M_doubled from £32,466 in 1909–10 to $68,957 in 1913–14 ; the L_total L_expenditure of the L_party L_organization from M_central L_funds L_also M_doubled from $73,000 to over £150,000 ."
ew1-fragment01,90,"To L_pay for this L_outpouring , a M_great M_drive was M_mounted for L_additional L_income -by L_Farquhar and L_Steel-Maitland ."
ew1-fragment01,91,In 1912 L_ordinary L_subscriptions L_still M_brought in only £12000 a L_year and it L_proved L_difficult to M_raise them to L_anything like what was L_needed .
ew1-fragment01,92,"The L_method M_adopted was to L_canvass for L_capital L_donations that could then be L_invested to M_bring in a M_regular L_income , and both L_Balfour and L_Law were L_used to M_raise the M_wind ."
ew1-fragment01,93,"L_Steel-Maitland L_told L_Balfour that "" L_Farquhar and I are L_endeavouring to M_raise more L_money ."
ew1-fragment01,94,I L_think we are L_likely to L_succeed — L_thanks in L_part to the very L_generous L_example M_set by L_Lord L_Rothschild .
ew1-fragment01,95,"But I would b , e very L_glad if I might L_see you on your L_return to L_ask you to L_help me in two L_cases ."
ew1-fragment01,96,"L_Systematic L_collections were M_made from L_peers and from the L_City ; by the L_outbreak of L_war the L_invested L_funds L_amounted to $671,000 — L_twice the L_sum in 1911 and L_worth four L_years "" L_expenditure — and there was a L_special L_cash M_deposit of £120,000 for the L_coming L_election ."
ew1-fragment01,97,"In three other M_areas , as L_much L_political as L_organizational , M_advances were M_made towards the L_management of the L_press , the M_coordination of the L_heterogeneous L_collection that L_made up the L_party , and the M_fostering of L_modern M_attitudes in the L_local L_parties ."
ew1-fragment01,98,Under L_Malcolm L_Fraser the L_party M_began to M_make L_effective L_use of its M_support in L_Fleet L_Street .
ew1-fragment01,99,"It had been M_recognized that L_Liberals had been more L_adept at M_handling the L_press because they were more L_ready to M_stoop to L_newspaper L_practices , as L_Sandars had L_reported in 1909 :"
ew1-fragment01,100,"I L_told L_Northcliffe that if his L_people would M_make L_enquiries at our L_Central L_Office , he would M_find that our L_nightly M_regiment of L_speakers was at L_least as L_well M_worth L_reporting as the L_Radical M_contingent , but that I L_realized that from the L_Press M_point of M_view , no L_doubt , our L_speakers did not L_play up to the L_reporters by> M_handing them their L_speeches in M_advance , and by other L_tricks of the L_kind to which the L_Radical L_orators have L_recourse ."
ew1-fragment01,101,This was the M_essence of the L_problem : the L_press could only be M_managed by L_someone who L_knew their L_methods and who would not L_expect them to L_come L_round to L_Central L_Office to M_search for L_news .
ew1-fragment01,102,"The L_UOC M_found that "" it is L_patent that some M_feeling L_exists among the L_Unionist L_Press that , while in the L_past they have done L_much for the L_Party , the L_Party has not M_assisted in their L_work ."
ew1-fragment01,103,"In L_many M_quarters it is L_asserted that the L_Unionist L_Press are L_treated with M_greater L_courtesy by the L_Radicals than by their own M_side . """
ew1-fragment01,104,"L_Fraser M_dealt with this L_problem without L_difficulty and L_explained to L_Law in 1913 that "" the L_importance of L_getting L_important L_speeches in M_advance is M_shown in M_concrete L_manner by your L_Wallsend L_speech on L_October 29th ."
ew1-fragment01,105,"The L_verbatim L_reports M_reached most of the L_newspapers in L_places such as L_Aberdeen at one o "" L_clock in the L_morning of the 30th . """
ew1-fragment01,106,He M_went on to L_quote the L_response that had been L_received from L_editors :
ew1-fragment01,107,L_Manchester L_Dispatch : I L_hope you will L_continue this M_form of L_enterprise .
ew1-fragment01,108,You L_fully L_know as an M_old L_pressman the L_difficulty of M_dealing with a M_big L_speech L_late at L_night …
ew1-fragment01,109,L_Daily L_Express : I am L_much L_obliged to you for the L_precis of L_Mr L_Bonar L_Law 's L_speech L_last L_night .
ew1-fragment01,110,It was a M_great L_help to us .
ew1-fragment01,111,The L_speech M_came over the L_wires so L_late and the M_sheets were so L_confused by the L_Post L_Office — which is L_usual in these L_cases — that without the L_precis we could not L_possibly have L_got the M_leader through in L_time for the L_first L_edition .
ew1-fragment01,112,"So in the L_supply of L_information to L_newspapers M_predisposed to M_support the L_party , L_much was L_achieved L_merely by L_employing a L_specialist ."
ew1-fragment01,113,"The other M_side of L_press L_management , L_depending on L_informal M_contacts , is L_less L_easy to M_assess ."
ew1-fragment01,114,In 1911 L_Steel-Maitland L_invited L_Blumenfeld of the L_Daily L_Express to L_Central L_Office for a L_two-way M_exchange of L_ideas and L_advice .
ew1-fragment01,115,"He L_also L_used L_Law himself to M_impress L_editors who were on L_less L_familiar L_terms with L_Fraser , as with L_Marlowe of the L_Daily L_Mail , and L_Law M_took a M_direct L_interest in L_negotiations with the most L_difficult of all the L_Unionist L_editors , J. L. L_Garvin of the L_Observer ."
ew1-fragment01,116,"L_Law L_personally M_conducted the L_negotiations with L_Gardner L_Sinclair over the L_sale of the L_Observer and the L_Pall L_Mall L_Gazette in 1914 ; this L_negotiation L_also M_demonstrates that , as L_well as M_producing L_information and M_nursing L_editors , the L_party had to M_work M_hard to L_keep some of the L_newspapers in L_business ."
ew1-fragment01,117,"L_Sinclair did L_buy the L_Observer and the L_Pall L_Mall in the M_end , but not before he had been M_given a $45,000 L_guarantee from L_party L_funds ."
ew1-fragment01,118,"Such L_investments had a M_double L_purpose , for they could M_bring in L_income and L_provide a L_political M_bonus ."
ew1-fragment01,119,"One such L_scheme L_involved the L_purchase of the L_Daily L_Express by L_Max L_Aitken with L_party L_funds , but the L_party was L_also M_propping up the L_Globe , the L_Standard , and a M_wide M_range of L_provincial L_dailies ."
ew1-fragment01,120,"All these L_transactions were L_secret , for there would be L_little L_use in L_keeping a L_paper M_alive if it were L_known to be owned by a L_political L_party ."
ew1-fragment01,121,The L_papers were L_therefore L_bought through L_nominees or L_bank L_loans M_backed with L_party L_capital .
ew1-fragment01,122,It was L_usual to M_extract some M_form of L_guarantee in M_exchange for L_party M_support but the L_secrecy L_prevented such L_undertakings from being L_enforced .
ew1-fragment01,123,"L_Sinclair L_thus M_gave an L_undertaking that his L_papers would L_always L_remain L_Unionist , but L_Steel-Maitland L_doubted if such a L_promise had any M_value ."
ew1-fragment01,124,"The L_later L_history of the L_Daily L_Express M_suggests not : when the L_Express L_became M_hostile in the 1920s , L_Younger L_raged "" when I L_think of the M_large L_sum of L_money this L_office has M_put into that M_gutter L_print it M_makes my L_blood M_boil "" ."
ew1-fragment01,125,The M_justification for M_pouring out M_large L_sums without a L_certain M_return was the L_even M_greater L_cost of any L_real L_alternative .
ew1-fragment01,126,"The M_support for the L_Express in 1912 "" L_provides for the L_introduction of £50,000 or $60,000 to L_retain the only L_half-penny L_paper the L_Party M_possesses in L_London , and no L_less a L_sum than $700,000 to £1 , 000,000 would be L_necessary to L_start a L_similar L_paper if the L_Daily L_Express were M_allowed to M_go ."
ew1-fragment01,127,"The M_struggle L_therefore M_went on to L_keep the L_Unionist L_press M_alive , and in 1912 and 1913 both L_Aitken and L_Northcliffe M_stood by the L_party and M_gave M_valuable M_support in their L_papers ."
ew1-fragment01,128,The M_coordination of L_competing L_party M_bodies was L_carried out with L_surprising L_ease .
ew1-fragment01,129,The L_National L_Union was L_merged with L_Central L_Office in 1911 and M_fusion with the L_Liberal L_Unionists M_followed in 1912 .
ew1-fragment01,130,L_Joseph L_Chamberlain L_retained his L_preference for L_independence but L_allowed himself to be M_overruled by L_Austen and by the L_overwhelming M_wishes of the L_Liberal L_Unionist L_Council to L_merge .
ew1-fragment01,131,"To M_cater for all L_susceptibilities , the L_party L_became the "" L_National L_Unionist L_Association of L_Conservative and L_Unionist L_Associations "" — a L_decision that M_allowed some L_local L_parties to M_go on L_calling themselves L_Conservative , but the L_name "" L_Liberal "" was at L_last M_dropped ."
ew1-fragment01,132,The L_Liberal L_Unionists were M_admitted to the L_Carlton L_Club and a L_longstanding M_source of M_tension was L_eradicated .
ew1-fragment01,133,This was in itself a L_striking M_commentary on what had L_already been done : L_Liberal L_Unionists who had M_resisted L_amalgamation under L_Balfour and L_Acland-Hood in 1911 L_acquiesced L_meekly under L_Law and L_Steel-Maitland in 1912 .
ew1-fragment01,134,Other L_organizations could not be M_absorbed but could L_still be M_brought within the L_Central L_Office M_orbit .
ew1-fragment01,135,So in 1911 L_Steel-Maitland L_offered to M_join the L_Halsbury L_Club in L_order to M_guide it on to M_safer M_lines — and was M_immediately L_accused of L_disloyalty by L_Walter L_Long .
ew1-fragment01,136,L_Long L_helped though by M_placing both L_Steel-Maitland and L_Boraston on the L_Executive L_Committee of the L_Union L_Defence L_League for the same L_purpose .
ew1-fragment01,137,"L_Steel-Maitland L_also L_explained to L_Lord L_Robert L_Cecil that "" it has been M_arranged that the L_National L_Conservative L_Union should M_send out L_leaflets L_produced by L_several of the L_ancillary L_organizations , such as the L_Tariff L_Reform L_League , the L_Anti-Socialist L_Union , the L_Primrose L_League , the L_London L_Municipal L_Society L_etc . """
ew1-fragment01,138,"The L_Central L_Office M_attitude was M_flexible , for M_outside M_bodies would L_always L_exist and could L_even be M_made L_use of :"
ew1-fragment01,139,"They M_represent a L_time when either their M_objects were not the same as those of the L_official L_organization , or the L_CCO was not M_enterprising L_enough to M_suit them ."
ew1-fragment01,140,But some L_caution should be M_observed .
ew1-fragment01,141,"It may be L_wise , while L_retaining or L_regaining M_control , to L_trade under L_different L_names ."
ew1-fragment01,142,"In some L_cases L_additional L_subscriptions may be L_obtained , in L_others M_full L_responsibility may be M_avoided ."
ew1-fragment01,143,"With M_open M_allies like the L_Primrose L_League , the L_case for L_collaboration was M_strong ; for the L_first L_time in thirty L_years of L_existence the L_Primrose L_League L_formally M_linked itself with the L_party in 1914 ."
ew1-fragment01,144,"On the other M_hand , the L_independence of the L_Tariff L_Reform L_League was a L_positive L_advantage : after L_January 1913 the L_party M_supported the L_tariff L_policy but was not L_including them in its M_immediate L_programme , so that L_Central L_Office could L_continue to M_distribute L_tariff L_propaganda from the L_TRL without L_compromising L_party L_policy ."
ew1-fragment01,145,"In L_general , L_efforts to L_ensure L_better M_coordination were a L_matter of the L_patient M_building up of M_contacts , although the L_improved L_party L_morale and the M_greater L_efficiency of L_Central L_Office had M_removed their M_justification for L_existence ."

fef-fragment03,637,"Since it is the L_equation M_formula that L_needs to be M_satisfied , we should L_choose the M_potential as a L_vector ( M_called , not without L_logic , the L_vector M_potential ) , M_defined by the L_equation M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,638,"M_Substituting the above L_equation into L_eqn ( 3.1 ) we M_get M_formula , or L_using the L_vector L_relation ( L_eqn ( A.6 ) ) we M_obtain the L_modified M_form M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,639,This L_equation can be further L_simplified to M_formula by L_choosing ( in the L_physicist 's L_jargon this is M_called L_choosing the M_gauge ) M_formula .
fef-fragment03,640,Can we do that ?
fef-fragment03,641,One ca n't L_usually M_assign some L_arbitrary M_value to the L_divergence of a L_vector M_function .
fef-fragment03,642,"In the M_present L_case , L_however , we do have some M_freedom of L_choice ."
fef-fragment03,643,The L_definition of A by L_eqn ( 3.8 ) is not L_unique .
fef-fragment03,644,"If we L_add to A the M_gradient of a M_scalar M_function , the L_resulting L_vector A' L_still M_gives the same L_magnetic M_field because M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,645,L_Hence a L_suitable L_choice of will L_ensure that M_formula .
fef-fragment03,646,So we are M_left with L_eqn ( 3.11 ) .
fef-fragment03,647,"If the M_current M_density is L_specified , L_eqn ( 3.11 ) will L_provide the L_solution for A from which B can be L_determined ."
fef-fragment03,648,How can we M_find a L_solution for A ?
fef-fragment03,649,There is L_nothing L_easier .
fef-fragment03,650,We only L_need to L_remember the L_differential L_equation for the M_scalar M_potential M_formula ( L_eqn ( 2.12 ) ) and its L_solution in the M_form of L_eqn ( 2.24 ) .
fef-fragment03,651,By L_analogy the L_general L_solution of L_eqn ( 3.11 ) is M_formula .
fef-fragment03,652,A M_simple M_integration will M_yield A if J is M_given .
fef-fragment03,653,We shall M_go through a L_number of L_examples L_later .
fef-fragment03,654,For the L_moment L_let us L_use the above M_expression for M_deriving L_Biot-Savart 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,655,"L_First we shall M_assume that the M_current M_density is L_confined to a L_thin L_wire in which L_case the M_integration L_variable may be L_changed to M_formula , where S is a L_vector L_normal to the L_cross-section , M_formula is the L_area of the L_cross-section , and L_dI is an L_elementary L_vector along the L_tangent of the L_wire ."
fef-fragment03,656,"L_Noting further that J.S = I and that I must be M_constant along the L_wire we may L_write L_eqn ( 3.15 ) in the L_modified M_form M_formula , L_whence the L_magnetic M_field M_strength is M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,657,We have to M_stop here for a L_moment to M_sort out the L_coordinates .
fef-fragment03,658,"As may be L_seen in Fig. 3.1 the L_coordinates of the L_wire L_element are x' , y' , z' , whereas the L_coordinates of the L_point where we L_wish to L_determine the L_magnetic M_field are L_set of L_coordinates ."
fef-fragment03,659,L_Thus the M_curl M_operates on the L_coordinates of P but not on those of L_dl M_leading to M_formula where L_ir is the L_unit L_vector in the L_direction r and we have M_made L_use of the L_vector L_relation ( A3 ) in the L_Appendix .
fef-fragment03,660,This is L_Biot-Savart 's M_law M_derived M_directly from L_Maxwell 's L_equations .
fef-fragment03,661,Are there any other M_ways of L_determining the L_magnetic M_field ?
fef-fragment03,662,"L_Well , one can L_use L_eqn ( 3.1 ) as it is , but very L_often one is L_better off by L_using its L_integral M_form that can be M_obtained by M_integrating both M_sides of L_eqn ( 3.1 ) over a L_surface M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,663,"By M_using L_Stokes ' L_theorem for the left-hand-side and L_recognizing that the L_integral of the M_current M_density M_gives the M_current , the above L_equation M_reduces to M_formula , where the M_line M_integration is along the L_curve C L_enclosing the L_surface ."
fef-fragment03,664,The M_positive M_sense of the M_integration M_path is L_defined L_relative to the M_positive M_current L_direction L_according to the L_usual M_right-hand M_convention .
fef-fragment03,665,L_Equation 3.21 ) is L_known as Ampère 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,666,We have now a L_number of L_equations M_describing the same L_thing .
fef-fragment03,667,"Which L_equation should we L_use in a L_practical L_case , the L_equation for the L_vector M_potential , Ampère 's M_law , L_Biot-Savart 's M_law , or M_attack M_directly L_Maxwell 's L_equations ?"
fef-fragment03,668,It 's M_hard to M_tell .
fef-fragment03,669,"L_Experience with L_practical L_calculations M_helps , but L_even after L_years of L_work one L_usually M_remains this M_side of L_infallibility ."
fef-fragment03,670,I L_regret to M_say that there are no L_general L_guidelines L_available .
fef-fragment03,671,If one M_manages to M_find the M_simplest L_method at the L_first L_attempt that can L_mostly be L_attributed to L_good L_luck .
fef-fragment03,672,Can we L_claim then that the L_vector M_potential is as L_useful as its M_scalar L_counterpart in L_electrostatics ?
fef-fragment03,673,For L_computational L_purposes the L_answer is an L_unambiguous no .
fef-fragment03,674,"It is L_always L_laborious to M_find the M_components of a L_vector , so we are not L_much L_better off with A than with H or B. It L_turns out L_however that A is a more L_basic M_quantity of L_physics than B. Since B is M_given by the M_curl of A it is L_possible that A is L_finite while its M_curl is L_zero ."
fef-fragment03,675,"L_Interestingly , under these L_conditions A has an L_effect on L_certain L_quantum-mechanical L_phenomena"
fef-fragment03,675a,"It would be L_unfair both to the L_vector M_potential and to L_quantum L_mechanics to M_say that L_none of those M_formulations have L_engineering M_applications ( in L_fact the most M_sensitive L_magnetometer L_built to L_date is M_based on that L_kind of L_theory ) , but by and L_large L_engineers would n't M_lose L_much L_sleep if the L_use of A were M_banned with M_immediate M_effect ."
fef-fragment03,676,"The L_vector M_potential is not a M_popular L_variable among L_engineers , L_maybe because it is not M_directly L_measurable ."
fef-fragment03,677,There are no L_instruments M_capable to L_measure the L_magnitude or L_direction of A.
fef-fragment03,678,In my L_opinion A is a L_useful L_thing if L_used with L_moderation .
fef-fragment03,679,"It M_helped us to M_derive L_Biot-Savart 's M_law , it will M_come M_handy L_later in L_solving L_certain L_radiation L_problems , and it L_often M_leads to M_nice M_formulae , e.g. for the L_magnetic M_flux L_crossing a L_surface , L_defined as M_formula that may be L_rewritten in L_terms of the L_vector M_potential as M_follows : M_formula where C is the L_curve L_enclosing the L_surface ."
fef-fragment03,680,We have now L_collected a M_good L_number of M_formulae which will M_serve us L_well in the M_following M_sections .
fef-fragment03,681,"Before M_going on , just a few L_words about the L_classification of M_steady M_currents ."
fef-fragment03,682,It may be M_roughly M_divided into two M_parts : L_magnetostatics and the L_rest .
fef-fragment03,683,"We shall L_discuss the L_rest L_first ( M_Sections 3.2–3.5 ) , and that will M_give us some L_idea of the L_relative M_significance of L_electric and L_magnetic M_fields ."
fef-fragment03,684,"M_Sections 3.6–3.16 are M_concerned with L_magnetostatics , where L_electric M_fields are M_assumed to be L_zero and the L_interrelationship of J , H , and B are M_studied ."
fef-fragment03,685,"Since we have so L_many L_variables , and since in each L_physical L_configuration only some of them M_appear , we will L_record ( just for this L_chapter ) the L_non-zero L_variables in each M_section L_heading ."
fef-fragment03,686,3.2 .
fef-fragment03,687,"The L_defocusing of an L_electron M_beam ( J , E , D , p , H , B )"
fef-fragment03,688,"We have so M_far L_talked about M_positive and M_negative M_charges , about M_point M_charges , and L_distributed M_charge ."
fef-fragment03,689,"I shall now M_introduce the L_concept of an L_elementary M_charge , 1.6 × 10 -19 C , M_carried by an L_elementary L_particle M_called the L_electron ."
fef-fragment03,690,This is not a L_necessity .
fef-fragment03,691,"It is L_possible to M_study L_electromagnetic L_theory without L_ever L_mentioning the L_word L_electron , but since it has L_become such a M_household L_word and is L_used so L_often we can just as L_well M_make L_use of it ."
fef-fragment03,692,In the M_present M_section we shall M_consider a L_cylindrical L_electron M_beam of L_radius a in which the M_charge M_density is L_uniform ( p = L_Po ) and all L_electrons M_travel with L_velocity v.
fef-fragment03,693,We are not M_going to L_enquire into the L_details how such M_beams can be L_produced ( it L_belongs to the M_subject of L_physical L_electronics ) ; we shall L_accept the L_fact that the M_beam L_exists and will L_try to L_work out the M_forces on the L_outermost L_electrons .
fef-fragment03,694,"There is now L_cylindrical L_symmetry and a L_net M_charge per L_unit L_length M_formula , M_yielding for the L_radial M_component of the L_electric M_field M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,695,"The L_magnetic M_field may be M_obtained from Ampère 's M_law ( L_eqn ( 3.21 ) ) as M_follows M_formula , where the M_line L_integral is M_taken over the L_circle of L_radius a ( Fig. 3.2 ) , I is the L_total M_current of the M_beam and M_formula is the L_azimuthal M_component of the L_magnetic M_field in the L_cylindrical L_coordinate L_system M_specified by M_formula] ."
fef-fragment03,696,From L_eqn ( 3.26 ) we M_get M_formula] .
fef-fragment03,697,The L_electric M_force on an L_electron of M_charge e M_travelling at the L_edge of the M_beam ( R = a ) is it is in the L_radial L_direction M_pointing L_outwards .
fef-fragment03,698,The L_magnetic M_force is L_perpendicular both to the L_direction of L_motion ( +z L_axis ) and the L_direction of L_magnetic M_field ( M_formula] L_direction ) .
fef-fragment03,699,The L_vectorial M_product v X B M_gives an L_inward M_force in the L_radial L_direction .
fef-fragment03,700,L_Hence the L_net M_force on the L_electron is M_formula] .
fef-fragment03,701,"L_Noting that M_formula] and L_anticipating the L_relationship M_formula] to be M_derived in M_Section 5.7 , we M_get the M_following M_formula for the M_force M_formula] , where c is the L_velocity of L_light ."
fef-fragment03,702,It may be M_seen from the above L_equation that the L_magnetic M_force is L_negligible in L_comparison with the L_electric M_force unless the L_velocity of the L_electron M_approaches the L_velocity of L_light .
fef-fragment03,703,"L_Thus the L_conclusion is that , L_owing to the L_repulsive M_forces between the L_electrons , a L_cylindrical L_electron M_beam is M_unstable ."
fef-fragment03,704,L_Using a M_technical M_term M_borrowed from L_electron L_optics we could M_say that the L_electron M_beam L_gets L_defocused .
fef-fragment03,705,The other L_conclusion ( as M_far as it is L_permissible to L_generalize from a L_single L_example ) is more L_important in L_principle .
fef-fragment03,706,It is M_concerned with the L_relative L_magnitudes of L_electric and L_magnetic M_forces .
fef-fragment03,707,Since M_charged L_particles L_rarely M_travel M_close to the L_velocity of L_light we may L_conclude that the L_magnetic M_forces are by L_orders of L_magnitude M_smaller than the L_electric M_forces .
fef-fragment03,708,Why is it then that we have no L_difficulties in L_practice in L_observing L_magnetic M_fields ?
fef-fragment03,709,"The L_reason is , of L_course , that there are two L_kinds of L_electric M_charges and M_their L_effect L_usually M_cancels , so the L_small L_magnetic M_field has a L_chance of L_getting L_observed ."
