a1j-fragment33,494,The L_Labour L_Party L_Conference : L_Policy L_review M_throws a M_spanner in the L_Whitehall M_machinery
a1j-fragment33,495,"By L_COLIN L_HUGHES , L_Political L_Correspondent"
a1j-fragment33,496,AN M_INCOMING L_Labour L_government would M_turn L_large L_areas of L_Whitehall M_upside down — but the L_party 's L_policy L_review L_barely M_considers the L_implications of its M_plans for L_restructuring L_government L_departments .
a1j-fragment33,497,"M_Scattered through the L_policy L_review are L_proposals to : L_Drastically L_alter the M_status and L_organisation of the L_Department of L_Trade and L_Industry ; L_Create two L_departments — a L_Department of L_Consumer L_Affairs , and a L_Department for L_Legal L_Administration ; L_Create a L_Department of L_Environmental L_Protection within the L_existing L_Department of the L_Environment ; M_Set up a L_plethora of L_new L_commissions and L_executive L_agencies ; M_Set up a L_Women 's L_Ministry ."
a1j-fragment33,498,Those are only the most L_overt L_changes L_advocated in the L_review L_papers .
a1j-fragment33,499,The only L_department which L_explicitly M_escapes L_unscathed is the one which L_Conservatives would most L_like to L_abolish : the L_Department of L_Energy .
a1j-fragment33,500,"In L_virtually every L_case the M_aim of L_causing L_upheaval is L_explicitly L_declared , because L_Labour 's M_aim would be to M_upset the L_bureaucratic M_order it M_inherits ."
a1j-fragment33,501,"L_New L_departments and L_quangos would , L_according to the L_review , be M_designed to M_act as M_irritants and L_antagonists within the L_Civil L_Service M_system ."
a1j-fragment33,502,"But the L_policy L_review M_nowhere M_considers the L_overall L_effect of the L_individual L_changes L_proposed , or how they might be M_co-ordinated ."
a1j-fragment33,503,Nor does it M_contemplate the L_knock-on L_consequences for L_Labour L_ministers of L_attempting to L_implement their L_programme while M_rebuilding the L_governmental M_machine .
a1j-fragment33,504,"The ‘ L_medium L_term L_industrial L_strategy ’ which would L_form the M_centrepiece of L_Labour 's L_economic L_policy would , L_according to the L_Productive and L_Competitive L_Economy L_review L_group , be ‘ L_administered by a L_transformed L_Department of L_Trade and L_Industry ’ ."
a1j-fragment33,505,"The L_review M_adds : ‘ What we now M_seek is a L_DTI which will have an L_equal , if not L_superior M_status , to that of the L_Treasury . ’"
a1j-fragment33,506,That M_approach would M_seek to M_knock out a M_keystone of L_Civil L_Service L_tradition .
a1j-fragment33,507,L_Labour L_policy has L_long M_sought to M_challenge the L_Treasury 's L_dominance in L_government .
a1j-fragment33,508,"But its L_last L_effort — the L_Department of L_Economic L_Affairs , M_set up by L_Harold L_Wilson and M_headed by L_George L_Brown — L_ended in L_futile L_departmental and L_ministerial L_infighting ."
a1j-fragment33,509,"There would in L_addition be a L_minister for L_Science and L_Technology at the L_newly M_supreme L_DTI , with L_responsibility for M_determing L_investment in L_research ."
a1j-fragment33,510,There is no M_mention in the L_education L_policy of how that might L_affect the L_Department of L_Education and L_Science .
a1j-fragment33,511,"But while the L_DTI would M_override the L_Treasury , a L_new ‘ M_powerful L_Department of L_Consumer L_Affairs ’ would M_antagonise the L_DTI ."
a1j-fragment33,512,It would be M_headed by ‘ a L_minister of L_Cabinet M_rank ’ and M_act as ‘ the L_consumers ’ M_voice with other L_government L_departments ' .
a1j-fragment33,513,"Its L_remit for L_inter-departmental M_intrusion would be M_wide , with ‘ a M_watching M_brief over L_government L_action ’ and the M_ability to L_initiate L_consumer L_legislation ."
a1j-fragment33,514,Only the L_Women 's L_Ministry would be M_given L_equal L_license .
a1j-fragment33,515,"It would be M_able to ‘ M_require each L_government L_department to L_review its L_policies , L_practices , and L_existing and L_proposed L_legislation ’ ."
a1j-fragment33,516,"While L_new L_departments are M_born and L_others M_extended , one of the M_oldest — the L_Home L_Office — would L_become a M_shadow of its M_present M_self ."
a1j-fragment33,517,"L_Labour 's L_proposed L_Department for L_Legal L_Administration would M_take over L_responsibility for L_courts and L_tribunals ; L_court L_procedures ; L_organisation , L_training and L_appointment of the L_legal L_profession , L_magistracy and L_judiciary ; L_legal L_aid ; L_legal L_services ; and the L_Sentencing L_Council ."
a1j-fragment33,518,"That would M_leave the L_Home L_Office with L_policing , L_penal L_policy and the L_criminal L_law ."
a1j-fragment33,519,"L_Responsibility for the L_Sex L_Discrimination L_Act , the L_Equal L_Pay L_Act and the L_Equal L_Opportunities L_Commission would be M_given to the L_Women 's L_Ministry ."
a1j-fragment33,520,The L_concept of a L_minister having L_Cabinet M_rank — and L_therefore L_implicitly not being a M_member of the L_Cabinet M_proper — L_crops up again on L_environment .
a1j-fragment33,521,A ‘ L_new L_Minister of L_Environmental L_Protection ’ would M_operate inside the L_DoE .
a1j-fragment33,522,That could M_work — though it is L_easy to L_imagine M_conflicts of M_interest with the L_housing and L_planning L_functions of the L_department .
a1j-fragment33,523,"More L_problematic will be L_Labour 's M_plan for the L_Ministry of L_Agriculture , L_Fisheries and L_Food ."
a1j-fragment33,524,"‘ The L_priority of L_MAFF must L_become L_food , not L_farming , ’ the L_policy L_review M_says ."
a1j-fragment33,525,"‘ Its L_main M_concerns would L_become L_food and the L_people who L_consume it , not L_farming and those who L_produce it . ’"
a1j-fragment33,526,"But the L_regulatory L_functions over the L_food L_industry , now M_split between L_MAFF and the L_Department of L_Health , would M_transfer to a L_new L_Food M_Standards L_Agency ."
a1j-fragment33,527,"That is the L_first of L_many L_agencies , L_executives , L_commissions , and other L_quango-like M_bodies M_recommended by the L_review ."
a1j-fragment33,528,"In some L_cases L_Labour 's L_quangos M_merge L_existing L_ones , or M_replace L_well-established M_bodies ."
a1j-fragment33,529,"The L_funding of M_higher L_education would L_become the L_responsibility of one M_body , L_rather than two ."
a1j-fragment33,530,L_Labour 's L_Quality L_Commission would M_replace the L_Audit L_Commission .
a1j-fragment33,531,"But there would be L_new L_regulatory L_commissions and L_consumer L_councils for every L_utility , along with L_ombudsmen , and L_public M_interest L_commissioners L_appointed by the L_Secretary of L_State ."
a1j-fragment33,532,"There would be L_Skills L_UK — a L_locally L_structured L_training L_commission — a M_Fair L_Wages L_Commission , a L_Health L_Technology L_Commission , a L_Health L_Quality L_Commission , an L_Education M_Standards L_Council , an L_Independent L_Sentencing L_Council , a L_Children 's L_Commissioner , an L_Environmental L_Protection L_Executive , and a L_Social L_Insurance L_Fund M_administered by … ‘ an L_independent L_commission ’ ."
a1u-fragment04,55,An M_atmosphere M_poisoned by L_mistrust
a1u-fragment04,56,By L_NICHOLAS L_ROE
a1u-fragment04,57,The L_disposal of L_toxic L_wastes is one of the most M_intractable L_problems M_facing L_industrialised L_societies .
a1u-fragment04,58,"L_Even though some of the most L_dangerous and M_persistent L_toxins , L_including L_polychlorinated L_biphenyls , L_PCBs , are no L_longer L_manufactured , L_quantities of them L_still L_exist , and must be M_got L_rid of ."
a1u-fragment04,59,But how ?
a1u-fragment04,60,And where ?
a1u-fragment04,61,"On this L_page , L_Nick L_Roe L_visits a M_plant which , despite L_strenuous L_public L_relations L_efforts , has M_failed to M_convince its L_neighbours that it has M_come M_clean ."
a1u-fragment04,62,"And L_Richard L_North M_looks at L_current L_provisions for the L_destruction of L_PCBs , and at the L_history of L_British L_involvement in a L_rather M_uncomfortable L_growth L_industry The L_security L_guard at the L_entrance to one of L_Britain 's L_mightiest L_hazardous L_waste L_disposal M_plants L_pressed a L_button and the L_gate L_opened ."
a1u-fragment04,63,Then he L_pressed another L_knob and a L_big L_toy L_doll in his L_office L_window M_dropped its L_trousers .
a1u-fragment04,64,You had to L_laugh .
a1u-fragment04,65,"L_Yet this was L_Rechem L_International 's M_high-temperature L_incineration M_plant at L_Pontypool in L_Gwent , L_South L_Wales ."
a1u-fragment04,66,"L_Hardly a L_laughing L_matter , L_surely ?"
a1u-fragment04,67,"Beyond the L_barrier M_lay some of the most L_toxic L_chemicals L_known , M_awaiting L_destruction by L_fire ."
a1u-fragment04,68,What L_else ?
a1u-fragment04,69,"A L_vast , L_smoke-blackened L_furnace ; 100 L_people to do the L_work ; M_massive L_investment — the L_company M_spent £2m L_last L_year on L_cleaning up L_smoke L_emissions ."
a1u-fragment04,70,"Plus a M_backdrop of L_houses M_covering the L_valley M_walls on either L_side , a L_reminder that wherever L_industrialised L_societies M_decide to M_deal with their most M_intractable L_problems , they are L_unlikely to M_find a L_place to do so which is not in L_somebody 's M_back M_yard ."
a1u-fragment04,71,"L_Britain M_grinds out L_almost five million L_tonnes of L_hazardous L_waste each L_year , of which about 63,000 L_tonnes are so L_difficult to L_store or L_treat that they are L_burnt at M_high L_temperatures here in L_Gwent or at one of three other M_centres : L_Ellesmere L_Port ; L_Fawley , near L_Southampton ; and the L_unfortunately L_named L_Killamarsh , near L_Sheffield ."
a1u-fragment04,72,Five more L_incinerators L_currently L_proposed in L_various L_parts of the L_country will L_double L_capacity .
a1u-fragment04,73,"Then there are the L_imports : 83,000 L_tonnes of L_toxic L_waste L_enter L_British L_ports L_annually for L_incineration or other L_treatment , a L_figure which has L_increased 20-fold in just eight L_years ."
a1u-fragment04,74,"In these L_environmentally M_conscious L_times , this is an M_uncomfortable L_growth L_industry ."
a1u-fragment04,75,"L_Liverpool L_dockers L_recently L_turned L_back L_parts of a 1,500-tonne L_consignment of L_Canadian L_PCBs ( L_polychlorinated L_biphenyls ) M_bound for this M_plant in L_Gwent ."
a1u-fragment04,76,"In doing so , they M_underlined a L_fact which is L_likely to M_attract more and more L_attention as L_tankers L_continue to L_shift L_toxins from L_town to L_town , L_country to L_country : the L_waste M_chain is M_long ."
a1u-fragment04,77,"It L_snakes in and out of L_ports , along our M_busiest L_highways and through our most L_crowded L_cities ."
a1u-fragment04,78,L_Anxieties which are L_currently M_felt most L_acutely by those L_living near L_destruction M_plants themselves may not L_always L_remain so L_localised .
a1u-fragment04,79,"At L_Pontypool , the M_collision between a L_precise , L_scientific L_industry and a M_diffuse , L_unscientific L_local L_suspicion is M_painfully L_apparent ."
a1u-fragment04,80,"L_Local L_people L_mutter and L_march , M_make L_speeches and L_throw L_things ; L_staff M_face L_sarcasm in L_nearby L_pubs ; and for L_years there have been L_demands for a L_public L_inquiry ."
a1u-fragment04,81,"L_Rechem has M_responded with a L_rather M_desperate L_open-door L_policy M_aimed at M_soothing L_fears , and more L_recently by L_issuing about a L_dozen L_writs against the L_fiercest L_critics ."
a1u-fragment04,82,"‘ We are an M_aggressive L_company , ’ M_admitted L_David L_Wheeler , M_operations L_director at this M_plant and at L_Rechem 's other L_incinerator , at L_Fawley ."
a1u-fragment04,83,"For a L_place so L_hated , the L_Pontypool M_plant L_looks L_innocuous L_inside , like a M_cross between an L_oil L_refinery and a L_crematorium ."
a1u-fragment04,84,"L_Mr L_Wheeler , an L_engineer who L_worked for L_many L_years in the L_oil M_business , is a L_pleasant , L_slightly L_worried-looking L_man who can not M_bear the L_fact that no L_one L_seems to L_realise just what M_lengths he M_goes to in L_order to M_keep the M_plant L_squeaky L_clean and M_emission-free ."
a1u-fragment04,85,"In L_hard L_hats and M_protective L_glasses , we L_walked past the L_huge ‘ L_fume M_cupboard ’ where the most L_noxious L_barrels are L_opened , and L_arrived at the L_vast , L_closed M_mouth of the L_furnace itself ."
a1u-fragment04,86,"It was L_hot , but not L_burning ."
a1u-fragment04,87,"There was a L_fault on the L_computer L_governing the M_plant , L_said L_Mr L_Wheeler , and the L_fire had L_automatically M_shut down ."
a1u-fragment04,88,"These L_pipes M_stretching L_thinly in a M_bridge across the L_service L_road M_injected a L_mix of L_chemicals into the L_walls of the L_furnace itself ; did I L_know that L_fuel was only L_used in the L_start-up L_process , after which the L_chemicals themselves L_provided the L_fire ?"
a1u-fragment04,89,L_Workers in L_blue L_overalls M_drifted around us and M_cracked L_jokes in M_gentle L_Welsh L_accents .
a1u-fragment04,90,In the L_furnace L_control L_office I L_found M_shift L_foreman L_Keith L_Thomas and L_asked L_innocently if he had any L_physical L_problems : ‘ Not since my L_vasectomy . ’
a1u-fragment04,91,A L_grin .
a1u-fragment04,92,"He L_lived L_locally , so how did L_neighbours M_view his L_job here ?"
a1u-fragment04,93,‘ You M_get L_sarcasm L_mainly .
a1u-fragment04,94,A M_lot of my L_friends are L_pleased that the L_company is doing the L_job they are doing .
a1u-fragment04,95,L_Others are not so L_well L_informed .
a1u-fragment04,96,You could n't L_hope to M_convert them . ’
a1u-fragment04,97,"At a L_nearby L_house , L_Leonard L_Hough , a L_retired L_schoolmaster , had L_earlier L_told me about ‘ the L_fog ’ which he L_says M_comes from the L_factory ."
a1u-fragment04,98,‘ It M_blows along the L_valley .
a1u-fragment04,99,They 've L_improved the L_chimney L_recently and it 's very L_much L_better than it was but we L_still M_get the L_smells .
a1u-fragment04,100,And since they 've L_refused L_repeatedly to have a L_public L_inquiry into what is M_going on there we 're not L_certain of the L_safety of what 's M_coming out .
a1u-fragment04,101,"We M_get L_smoke from the L_steel L_works across the L_valley , but we L_know what that is and we 're not L_afraid of it . ’"
a1u-fragment04,102,L_Keith L_Thomas L_pressed a L_button and a L_huge L_door L_clanked L_upwards so that I could L_peer into the M_heart of the L_furnace .
a1u-fragment04,103,L_Piles of L_ruddy-brown L_ash M_lay L_heaped on the L_floor .
a1u-fragment04,104,L_Pumps M_sucked L_air L_inwards .
a1u-fragment04,105,L_Heat L_shone out .
a1u-fragment04,106,"In here , they L_burn about 30,000 L_tonnes of L_chemicals a L_year , a M_quarter L_originating outside L_Britain ."
a1u-fragment04,107,The L_waste L_arrives at the M_rate of up to seven L_tanker-loads every L_day — that is seven L_lorries L_passing L_thousands of L_doorsteps .
a1u-fragment04,108,"L_Right here , in this M_gaping M_mouth , M_lies the M_end of the M_chain ."
a1u-fragment04,109,"The L_wastes L_include L_lindane , L_DDT , L_out-of-date L_drugs , L_carcinogenic L_chemicals , L_old L_cigars and L_even L_pornography ( a L_different L_kind of M_pollution ) ."
a1u-fragment04,110,"About 7,000 L_tonnes of the L_total L_waste is L_PCB-contaminated ."
a1u-fragment04,111,"L_PCBs are so L_difficult to L_destroy , that L_Rechem 's L_emission-monitoring L_systems are L_geared to L_detecting them on the M_grounds that if you L_destroy L_PCBs you L_destroy L_everything ."
a1u-fragment04,112,"This , of L_course , is a L_key M_point ."
a1u-fragment04,113,"If you did not L_burn L_chemicals like L_PCBs , what L_else would you do with them ?"
a1u-fragment04,114,The L_sea ?
a1u-fragment04,115,The L_earth ?
a1u-fragment04,116,"‘ We are not in the M_business of L_polluting the L_environment , ’ L_Mr L_Wheeler L_insisted ."
a1u-fragment04,117,‘ We are on the M_side of the M_angels . ’
a1u-fragment04,118,"L_Environmental L_organisations , L_however , M_put the M_emphasis M_elsewhere ."
a1u-fragment04,119,"‘ There is no L_incinerator which L_completely L_destroys L_toxic L_wastes , ’ L_Madeleine L_Cobbing , L_Greenpeace 's L_toxics L_campaigner , L_told me ."
a1u-fragment04,120,"‘ The L_crux of our L_argument is that we do n't L_need to have L_toxic L_wastes and the L_fact that M_plants like L_Rechem L_exist , L_providing L_easy L_options for L_companies , is M_acting as a L_disincentive for L_companies to M_clean up . ’"
a1u-fragment04,121,But — another but — what about the L_PCBs that L_already L_exist ?
a1u-fragment04,122,"Although they are no L_longer L_manufactured , they are L_still L_present , for L_example in L_electrical L_equipment ."
a1u-fragment04,123,"No L_one could L_therefore M_call for the L_closure of L_incineration M_plants at a M_stroke , because L_noxious L_chemicals have to M_go L_somewhere ."
a1u-fragment04,124,So a M_part of the L_argument M_switches to the L_kind of L_incinerators you L_allow while L_industry is M_forced to M_clean itself up .
a1u-fragment04,125,"L_Also , how these should L_function and — L_perhaps most L_important of all — where you L_put them ."
a1u-fragment04,126,"L_Mr L_Wheeler , now L_moving to the L_rear of the M_plant to L_show off the £2m L_smoke-cleaning M_section , which had just L_broken down , M_pointed out that his L_company M_achieved L_destruction of at L_least 99.9999 per L_cent of all L_materials ."
a1u-fragment04,127,"The L_company 's L_figures L_imply that when you have L_burnt 99.9999 per L_cent of a 30,000-tonne L_annual L_throughput , a L_figure of 0.03 of a L_tonne M_remains ."
a1u-fragment04,128,"In 1986 , L_according to M_Friends of the L_Earth , a M_survey of the L_homes L_clustered on the L_surrounding L_hills M_found that L_three-quarters of 800 L_residents were L_opposed to the L_Rechem M_plant ."
a1u-fragment04,129,"‘ The M_plant should be L_relocated because it 's in the L_wrong L_place , ’ L_Llew L_Smith , the L_local L_Euro-MP , L_told me ."
a1u-fragment04,130,‘ It is in a L_valley and in a L_highly L_populated L_area . ’
a1u-fragment04,131,What did L_Mr L_Wheeler M_make of that ?
a1u-fragment04,132,"‘ If we do it L_properly any L_spot is the L_right L_spot , ’ he L_insisted ."
a1u-fragment04,133,"M_Stack L_emissions of L_PCBs were below the L_American M_standard for L_breathing L_air - 1,000 L_times M_lower than the L_British L_equivalent ."
a1u-fragment04,134,L_Regular L_soil and L_grass L_tests M_showed no L_difference between L_PCB L_contamination in the L_immediate L_area and L_elsewhere in L_Wales — though there are no L_established ‘ L_safe ’ M_levels for these .
a1u-fragment04,135,Five L_air-monitoring M_plants had been L_installed ( he L_took me to L_see them ) .
a1u-fragment04,136,"And here were L_drums of L_chemicals , each L_labelled , each with a L_job L_number to L_check against L_sampling ."
a1u-fragment04,137,And L_yet there are L_accidents .
a1u-fragment04,138,"In 1987 , L_aluminium L_melted in the L_furnace , M_reacted with L_water and L_exploded , M_sending a L_black L_cloud over L_nearby L_houses ."
a1u-fragment04,139,"L_Later , L_drums L_supposedly L_containing L_carcinogenic L_drugs were not L_opened for L_checking before L_burning ( for L_health L_reasons ) and three were ‘ L_misdescribed ’ ."
a1u-fragment04,140,"They , too , L_reacted with L_water , and a M_plant L_operator was L_burned by a M_cloud of L_acid L_gas ."
a1u-fragment04,141,"We L_walked past a L_tanker where a L_huge L_man L_named L_Andy L_Matthews was L_pumping L_vinyl L_acetate into a 10,000-gallon L_vat , M_wreathed in its M_sweet , M_sickly L_smell : ‘ I 've been here two L_years , ’ he L_said ."
a1u-fragment04,142,"‘ My L_father was an L_industrial L_chemist and he L_said if you L_want to L_go and L_work for them , L_go and L_work for them . ’"
a1u-fragment04,143,Were there any L_spillages ?
a1u-fragment04,144,He L_shrugged .
a1u-fragment04,145,‘ L_Nothing L_major .
a1u-fragment04,146,I might L_drop a L_pipe — a L_little M_bit of a L_splash . ’
a1u-fragment04,147,"In a L_large , L_prefabricated L_shed we L_wandered L_past L_stacks of 45-gallon L_drums of L_PCBs , two L_drums L_high , about 10 L_deep ; and there were L_contaminated L_transformers M_waiting to be M_cut up and M_roasted in the L_flames ."
a1u-fragment04,148,"M_Back along the L_waste M_chain , the L_Liverpool L_dockers who L_objected to the L_import of L_exactly this L_type of L_chemical should be L_aware that L_PCBs are M_moving about our L_roads all the L_time ."
a1u-fragment04,149,There was no L_difference between the L_liquid in these L_drums and the L_liquid in the L_cargoes they L_refused to L_touch .
a1u-fragment04,150,"In L_Liverpool , a L_dockers ' L_spokesman with the L_Transport and L_General L_Workers L_Union L_admitted : ‘ L_Drivers are n't L_happy L_handling some of these L_commodities , but at L_least a L_lorry-driver has more L_idea of what he is L_handling than a L_docker , who could have a L_consignment and just not L_know what it is . ’"
a1u-fragment04,151,"L_Yet he did not L_oppose all L_toxic L_waste L_movement ( after all , the same L_union L_represents L_workers at L_Rechem itself ) ; he L_simply did n't L_like the L_idea that M_big L_industrial L_nations like L_Canada could M_dump their M_dirty L_problems on this L_country and his M_members ."
a1u-fragment04,152,"L_Driving L_away , I L_noticed that the L_vast L_chimney was L_still not L_functioning , but when I M_called at a L_neighbouring L_house a L_woman L_showed me L_videos she had M_taken of L_smoke M_coming from the M_plant , M_settling in her L_garden ."

a31-fragment03,115,WHEN M_things L_go L_wrong you can L_sue more L_often than you may L_think .
a31-fragment03,116,L_Money may not have M_changed M_hands .
a31-fragment03,117,L_Someone may have L_even done you a L_favour .
a31-fragment03,118,It does n't L_matter .
a31-fragment03,119,"As L_long as you can M_show that they L_owed you a L_legal L_duty to be L_careful and have been L_negligent , L_damages could M_come your M_way ."
a31-fragment03,120,There are a L_number of M_points to M_bear in L_mind .
a31-fragment03,121,"L_Take up L_references before M_giving L_credit , L_lending L_money , L_letting in L_tenants , L_taking on L_staff ."
a31-fragment03,122,"M_Ask L_banks , L_building L_societies , L_former L_landlords , M_present and L_past L_employers ."
a31-fragment03,123,"If you L_rely to your L_detriment on a L_misleading L_reference which was M_given L_negligently , you should be L_able to L_sue the L_referee ."
a31-fragment03,124,"The M_subject of a L_bad L_reference can L_sue the L_referee for L_libel but has to M_show the L_referee was upto no L_good : L_spite , M_ill-will or some L_improper L_motive will do ."
a31-fragment03,125,"L_Take along a L_prosperous M_adviser on all L_shopping L_sprees , L_demonstrate a M_high M_degree of L_trust and M_strong L_reliance in what they L_say and you may have L_unexpected L_protection should the L_seller L_go out of L_business and the L_goods M_fall to M_pieces ."
a31-fragment03,126,A 26-year-old L_woman L_accountant who L_knew L_nothing about the L_mechanical M_side of L_vehicles L_asked her more L_knowledgeable L_friend to L_find a L_car for her .
a31-fragment03,127,She L_stipulated that it must L_never have been L_involved in an L_accident .
a31-fragment03,128,The L_friend L_found one at a L_garage .
a31-fragment03,129,"Although he L_failed to L_check it had been L_accident-free , he L_assured the L_lady that this was the L_case ."
a31-fragment03,130,She M_bought it .
a31-fragment03,131,It had been in an L_accident and it was L_worthless .
a31-fragment03,132,"In L_May L_last L_year the L_Court of L_Appeal L_upheld a L_judgment against the L_friend for more than £5,500 L_damages for L_negligence because he had L_owed the L_accountant a L_duty of L_care ."
a31-fragment03,133,Your L_conservatory L_collapses as a L_result of L_negligence of the L_professionals who were L_engaged by the L_previous L_owner to L_put it up .
a31-fragment03,134,"You can L_sue the L_professionals — L_builders , L_architects , L_surveyors or L_engineers — by M_courtesy of the L_Defective L_Premises L_Act 1972 , despite the L_fact that you L_never had a L_contract with them yourself ."
a31-fragment03,135,"There are M_strict L_time L_limits : L_generally , six L_years from when L_damage L_first M_occurred ; where the L_damage was L_initially ‘ L_latent ’ you are M_given L_longer — three L_years from when you could have L_discovered it , with a longstop of 15 L_years ."
a31-fragment03,136,It may L_also be L_possible to L_claim L_damages against a L_local L_authority for L_negligently M_failing to L_ensure that L_construction L_work M_complied with the L_relevant L_building L_regulations .
a31-fragment03,137,A L_solicitor L_fails to L_draw up a will within a M_reasonable L_time for a L_client who L_subsequently L_dies .
a31-fragment03,138,You M_lose the L_gift which the will would have M_made .
a31-fragment03,139,"You can L_sue the L_solicitor for what you would have M_collected , had he done his L_job L_properly , because the L_law M_reckons he L_owed you , as L_well as his L_client , a L_duty of L_care ."
a31-fragment03,140,"When you L_want to L_borrow on a L_mortgage , the L_prospective L_lenders will have the L_property L_valued at your L_expense ."
a31-fragment03,141,There is no L_contract between you and the L_valuer .
a31-fragment03,142,"But if the L_valuer is L_negligent and you L_buy the L_property L_relying on his L_report , you may L_still be L_able to L_sue him for L_damages ."
a31-fragment03,143,This is what the L_House of L_Lords M_decided in two L_cases L_last L_April in L_spite of an L_attempt to M_get the L_valuers off the M_hook by a L_disclaimer which M_said : ‘ I L_accept that the L_valuer does not L_warrant L_anything L_stated in his L_report as being M_accurate …
a31-fragment03,144,"‘ L_Alas , L_disclaimers may M_work if , for L_example , the L_property being L_valued is L_industrial or an L_expensive L_house ."
a31-fragment03,145,L_Disclaimers may L_also be L_used by L_referees and L_others to M_rob you of a L_claim for L_damages .
a31-fragment03,146,Whoever L_attempts to M_hide behind a L_disclaimer must L_prove it is M_fair and L_reasonable to do so .
a31-fragment03,147,But a L_disclaimer can L_never M_take M_away your L_rights under the L_Defective L_Premises L_Act 1972 for the L_collapsing L_conservatory or L_prevent L_anyone being L_sued for L_negligence which has L_caused L_death or L_injury .
a31-fragment03,148,Have we L_yet M_reached the M_point at which we would be L_awarded L_damages against the L_Meteorological L_Office because we L_went L_camping on the L_day of an L_unforecast L_hurricane ?

a36-fragment07,180,By MARTIN PACEY
a36-fragment07,181,"IT WAS L_unfair of L_Auden to M_suggest , in his ‘ L_Letter to L_Lord L_Byron ’ , that a L_poet 's ‘ M_sense of other L_people 's very M_hazy ’ ."
a36-fragment07,182,But the M_vaporous M_presences that M_float through this M_slender and M_anaemic L_first L_novel by a L_notable L_poet would L_appear to M_support the L_claim .
a36-fragment07,183,The L_book — which M_opens a M_projected L_sequence of L_novels that will M_cover the L_period from 1968 to the M_present L_day — M_aims to M_explore what the L_blurb M_describes as ‘ the M_painful L_transition from L_youth to L_adulthood ’ .
a36-fragment07,184,"This , of L_course , is a L_popular M_subject : it L_seems L_particularly M_attractive to the L_poet-turned-novelist because of the L_scope it L_offers for the M_tremulously M_sensitive M_probing of L_feelings ."
a36-fragment07,185,"M_Sensitivity , L_though , is not L_enough ."
a36-fragment07,186,What L_Andrew L_Motion M_presents us with here is a L_static and M_humourless M_mood-piece M_filled with over-elaborate M_imagery .
a36-fragment07,187,"The L_hero , L_Francis L_Mayne , is L_suffering from the L_adolescent 's L_emotional L_confusion and L_acute L_self-consciousness ."
a36-fragment07,188,"He M_finds it M_hard to L_communicate with L_people , not L_least his L_separated L_parents ."
a36-fragment07,189,"His L_father is a L_faceless L_figure : a L_retired L_brigadier , M_reserved and L_taciturn ."
a36-fragment07,190,"His L_mother , by M_contrast , is the most M_vividly L_realised L_character in the L_book : L_nervy , L_flirtatious and L_selfish , L_already on her L_third L_husband , she L_thinks L_primarily of her L_appearance , L_even when L_visiting her L_dying L_daughter , L_Francis 's L_twin ."
a36-fragment07,191,The L_first L_half of the L_novel is M_dominated by the L_girl 's L_death from L_leukaemia .
a36-fragment07,192,"There is a M_refreshing L_simplicity and M_tenderness in L_Motion 's M_account of the M_way L_Francis L_nurses her , but she herself is too L_sketchily M_drawn for the L_episode to M_carry L_much M_weight ."
a36-fragment07,193,"L_Meanwhile , at his L_public L_school , L_Francis is M_conducting a L_love-affair with an L_older L_pupil L_named L_Keith L_Ogilvie ."
a36-fragment07,194,"He is L_finally L_rejected by the M_devious , L_arrogant L_Keith , who L_informs him that he is ‘ M_obsolete ’ because he does not ‘ L_know how to M_make M_things L_happen ’ ."
a36-fragment07,195,His M_response to this L_rejection is as M_flat as his M_reaction to the M_massive L_demonstration which L_Keith has L_earlier L_persuaded him to M_join against the L_Vietnam L_War .
a36-fragment07,196,"This M_violent L_event , L_described at L_length in M_hysterically M_colourful L_terms , is the only M_piece of L_history to be M_woven L_convincingly into the M_plot ."
a36-fragment07,197,"Other M_broad L_hints as to the L_date are M_inserted with a L_comical L_lack of L_subtlety : ‘ My L_God , L_darling , have you L_heard ? ’ L_exclaims L_Francis 's L_mother one L_day as she L_greets him , ‘ L_Czechoslovakia ."
a36-fragment07,198,It 's been L_invaded . ’
a36-fragment07,199,L_Motion will have to do L_better than this if he L_seriously L_intends his L_series of L_novels to M_capture the M_feel of a L_period .
a36-fragment07,200,But the L_book 's L_principal L_defect L_remains the L_vacuity of its L_protagonist .
a36-fragment07,201,"In his L_eagerness to L_depict the M_cloudy L_psychology of an L_adolescent , L_Motion has L_forgotten to M_give the L_boy a L_personality ."
a36-fragment07,202,"He has , L_however , M_given him a L_psychotic L_compulsion to L_formulate L_fanciful L_similes ."
a36-fragment07,203,"L_Hardly a L_page M_goes by without the L_hapless L_Francis L_noticing L_something which L_reminds him , L_improbably , of L_something L_else ."
a36-fragment07,204,L_Sometimes he is L_reminded of L_several M_things .
a36-fragment07,205,"One L_moment an L_avenue of L_chestnut L_trees L_looks ‘ like a M_child 's M_drawing of M_ghosts ’ ; the M_next it L_appears ‘ L_frightening but L_derelict , like M_extinguished M_chandeliers ’ ; and L_finally the L_chestnuts ‘ M_prance at him , M_holding up their L_gleaming L_branches like M_hysterics . ’"
a36-fragment07,206,"Such L_writing L_rapidly L_palls , and I L_hope that in the L_novels to M_come , L_Motion can L_curb his L_reckless L_passion for it ."

a3m-fragment02,53,They are as L_much a L_part of L_Milan as L_La L_Scala or the L_Galleria L_Vittore L_Emmanuele .
a3m-fragment02,54,L_Last L_month it was L_announced that L_Britain will M_get its L_first M_new-wave L_trams in 1991 .
a3m-fragment02,55,"M_Destined to M_run in L_Manchester , they will M_relieve L_traffic M_congestion and M_help to M_reduce the M_levels of L_carbon L_monoxide in the L_city L_centre , L_outlying L_suburbs and M_satellite L_towns of L_Bury , L_Altrincham , L_Salford , L_Oldham and L_Rochdale ."
a3m-fragment02,56,"In L_Britain , with the L_main L_exception of L_Blackpool ( not L_forgetting the L_single-deckers of the L_Isle of L_Man and L_Llandudno ) , L_trams had been L_largely L_relegated to the L_history L_books ."
a3m-fragment02,57,"L_Otherwise , the L_best L_place to L_see M_working L_trams has been the L_tram L_museum at L_Crich in L_Derbyshire or L_else in L_old L_British L_Transport L_Commission L_films and L_Ealing L_comedies ."
a3m-fragment02,58,L_Trams L_disappeared from most L_British L_cities in the 1950s .
a3m-fragment02,59,L_London 's M_venerable L_red and L_cream L_double-deckers L_rumbled along the L_Thames L_embankment for the L_last L_time in 1952 .

a3m-fragment02,61,"L_Trams , it was L_believed until L_surprisingly L_recently , are L_old-fashioned ."
a3m-fragment02,62,"They had L_something to do with L_fish and L_chips L_wrapped in L_newspaper , L_men in L_hats , L_National L_Health L_specs , L_smog and L_powdered L_egg ."
a3m-fragment02,63,"They M_held up the M_bright L_new L_diesel L_buses and , L_even L_worse , M_blocked the L_progress of L_private L_motorists in M_bulbous L_Austins and M_lumpen L_Humbers in M_canyon-like L_city L_thoroughfares ."
a3m-fragment02,64,They M_picked up L_power from a M_spider 's M_web of L_unsightly L_overhead L_wires .
a3m-fragment02,65,"They were M_inflexible in M_operation , L_draughty , and L_mobile L_reminders of L_TB L_epidemics with the L_enamelled ‘ Do Not L_Spit ’ L_signs L_screwed to their L_bulkheads ."
a3m-fragment02,66,But the L_modern L_tram could L_hardly be more L_different .
a3m-fragment02,67,It M_plays a L_key M_role in M_keeping L_city L_streets on the L_move and is L_even the L_object of the L_best L_modern L_designers ' L_desire .
a3m-fragment02,68,"In L_Milan , for L_example , the L_commission to L_design the L_new M_generation of ‘ L_Jumbo ’ L_trams , which M_went into L_service in 1979 , was one that M_leading L_Italian L_architects and L_designers M_fought over ."
a3m-fragment02,69,"After all , the L_Jumbo , a M_handsome and L_imposing L_articulated L_unit L_designed by L_architect , L_engineer and L_critic L_Klaus L_Giovanni L_Koenig , will be L_seen on the L_streets of L_Milan for the M_next M_half-century ."
a3m-fragment02,70,"L_Spotlessly L_clean and L_popular , the L_Jumbo is a L_long-term L_advertisement for L_Koenig 's L_design L_skills ."
a3m-fragment02,71,The L_modern L_tram is a L_green L_machine .
a3m-fragment02,72,"M_Assuming the L_power L_station at the L_end of the L_line M_burns L_cleanly , the L_tram is L_virtually L_pollution M_free ."
a3m-fragment02,73,"M_Standing at L_traffic L_lights a L_Koenig-designed L_Jumbo is , L_save for the L_chatter L_inside , L_completely L_silent ."
a3m-fragment02,74,The L_overhead L_wires are so M_slight that you have to L_look M_hard to L_see them .
a3m-fragment02,75,"L_Powers of L_acceleration and L_braking are L_remarkable , the L_latter M_far M_greater than any L_car ."
a3m-fragment02,76,"But L_sadly , there is no L_indication that the L_GMA L_consortium which will M_design , M_operate and M_maintain the L_first of the L_new M_generation L_British L_trams in L_Manchester will M_share the L_looks of their L_Milanese L_counterparts ."
a3m-fragment02,77,"L_Artists ' M_impressions M_show a L_tram that has more in L_common with the M_flat-faced , L_characterless M_light L_trains of the M_toy-like L_Docklands L_Light L_Railway ."
a3m-fragment02,78,"There is L_still L_time for L_GMA ( L_GEC , L_Mowlem , L_Amec and L_Greater L_Manchester L_Buses ) to M_consider L_employing an L_inspired L_architect or L_industrial L_designer ."
a3m-fragment02,79,"After all , L_Mancunians and L_visitors to the L_Manchester L_conurbation are L_going to have to L_look at these L_mechanical M_millipedes for L_well into the L_twenty-first L_century ."
a3m-fragment02,80,"Now that L_buses are no L_longer L_designed to L_enhance the L_streets they M_serve , L_Manchester has a L_chance to M_make a M_fresh M_start with its L_trams ."
a3m-fragment02,81,L_Manchester is not M_alone .
a3m-fragment02,82,"Other L_British L_towns , L_Croydon and L_Southampton among them , are L_also M_considering L_modern L_tramways ."
a3m-fragment02,83,"These are all L_referred to as ‘ L_supertram ’ L_networks , the L_implication being that the M_new-generation L_tram is an L_altogether more M_dynamic M_form of L_transport than its L_pre-war M_predecessors ."
a3m-fragment02,84,What it L_really M_means is that the L_new L_trams are a M_hybrid between L_street L_car and L_lightweight L_suburban L_train .
a3m-fragment02,85,"Although they will M_slip through the L_city L_centre M_serving the L_essential L_parts — L_shopping L_malls , L_leisure L_centres , L_theme L_parks , L_amusement L_arcades and L_museums — the L_Manchester L_supertrams will L_also M_head out of L_town on a M_mix of L_reserved L_track and L_existing L_railway L_lines ."
a3m-fragment02,86,"The L_supertram is , in L_effect , a M_low-cost L_replacement for L_British L_Rail 's M_ageing M_fleet of L_suburban L_diesel L_multiple-unit L_trains , those M_rasping L_diesels which M_change L_gear to the M_accompaniment of M_voluminous M_clouds of L_acrid L_black L_exhaust L_fumes and the M_blessing of L_train L_spotters ."
a3m-fragment02,87,"They will M_perform some of the same L_functions , but they will not be an L_exact L_replacement for L_traditional L_trams ."
a3m-fragment02,88,"And although the L_supertram L_concept will M_spread through L_major L_cities during the M_next L_decade , L_Blackpool will L_still be L_alone in its M_use of L_traditional L_double-deckers ."

a7w-fragment01,32,"The M_move was M_signalled L_last L_week and , M_true to their L_promised M_response , L_management M_suspended the L_workers L_involved in the L_disruption ."
a7w-fragment01,33,But ‘ M_posturing and M_pretending ’ M_went M_far beyond the L_unions .
a7w-fragment01,34,"L_Mr L_Clarke has been L_indulging in just that himself , M_putting up the L_luckless L_Duncan L_Nichol , L_chief L_executive of the L_health L_service , to M_take the L_initial M_flak under the L_pretence that the L_dispute is not his M_direct L_responsibility ."
a7w-fragment01,35,"Yet it was L_Mr L_Clarke , not L_Mr L_Nichol , who was L_involved in the M_critical L_decisions — the L_cash M_limit for the L_NHS , the 6.5 per L_cent L_offer to L_ambulance L_workers ( M_compared to seven per L_cent for L_nurses , eight per L_cent for L_doctors and nine per L_cent for L_ancillary L_workers ) ; and L_today 's M_introduction of L_military L_ambulances ."
a7w-fragment01,36,L_Ambulance L_workers on L_emergency L_work do L_deserve a L_much M_higher L_increase .
a7w-fragment01,37,They have M_progressed M_far beyond L_routine L_first L_aid .
a7w-fragment01,38,"Their L_paramedical L_skills M_cover L_highly L_technical L_procedures : L_intubation , L_infusion and L_defebrillation ."
a7w-fragment01,39,"The M_crews are M_able to L_resuscitate L_heart L_attack L_patients , L_replace L_fluid L_intraveneously after M_severe L_blood L_loss , and L_insert L_tubes to L_maintain L_air L_supplies in L_unconconscious L_casualties ."
a7w-fragment01,40,"L_Yet the L_ambulance L_worker is only being L_offered £10,000 , when a L_fire L_officer is being L_given £13,000 and a L_Metropolitan L_police L_constable can L_earn £25,000 ."
a7w-fragment01,41,But only two million out of the 20 million L_journeys which L_ambulance M_crews M_carry out each L_year are L_emergency L_calls .
a7w-fragment01,42,"Nine out of 10 are L_routine M_calls , L_many of which could be M_carried out by L_mini L_cabs ."
a7w-fragment01,43,L_Mr L_Duncan L_Nichol L_wants to M_separate the L_emergency from the L_non-emergency L_work .
a7w-fragment01,44,He is L_right to M_pursue this M_line .
a7w-fragment01,45,L_Wiltshire and L_Northumbria have L_already M_shown how L_much can be L_achieved .
a7w-fragment01,46,The M_ramshackle L_Whitley L_Council L_negotiating M_machinery is the other L_reason why the L_ambulance L_workers have L_lost out .
a7w-fragment01,47,"Until this L_year , the three L_independent L_review M_bodies which M_make L_recommendations for L_nurses , L_doctors and the L_professions M_allied to L_medicine have M_given L_much M_higher L_awards than the L_Whitley L_Councils ."
a7w-fragment01,48,"As L_Lord L_McCarthy M_noted some 13 L_years L_ago , the L_management M_side of the L_councils L_comprise ‘ L_employers who do not L_pay and L_paymasters who do not L_employ . ’"
a7w-fragment01,49,A L_much more M_flexible M_system which would M_allow L_local L_managers to L_negotiate L_local L_rates — on a L_national L_pay M_spine — is L_needed .
a7w-fragment01,50,A M_crisis ; an M_agenda for L_reform and L_honesty .
a7w-fragment01,51,One L_Mr L_Clarke can not M_duck M_away from if he L_wants to M_avoid a L_second L_Winter of L_Discontent ..
a7w-fragment01,52,"M_Opening , M_closing ."
a7w-fragment01,53,L_PRINCE L_CHARLES is L_jolly L_good at M_opening M_things .
a7w-fragment01,54,"He L_needs to be for the M_next four L_days in L_Hong L_Kong , because he will be M_hard at L_work L_cutting L_ribbons and L_laying L_foundation L_stones ."
a7w-fragment01,55,"The L_Hong L_Kong L_University of L_Science and L_Technology , the L_Hong L_Kong L_Island L_Divisional M_Headquarters of the L_Red L_Cross , the L_new L_Cultural M_Centre , and L_many more ."
a7w-fragment01,56,He is L_even L_re-opening the L_already M_opened L_Eastern L_Harbour L_tunnel and L_subway L_crossing .
a7w-fragment01,57,"It is all L_standard L_royal M_stuff , but not L_much L_help to the L_millions who L_fear that L_Hong L_Kong will not L_remain M_open after 1997 ."
a7w-fragment01,58,"The M_whole M_point of a L_visit to L_Hong L_Kong now , five L_months after L_Tiananmen L_Square , should be to L_declare with L_royal L_authority that L_Britain M_shares the L_concerns of the L_Hong L_Kong L_people and is M_determined to do L_something about them ."
a7w-fragment01,59,"There was L_already a L_rather L_perfunctory M_air to the L_Queen 's L_visit three L_years L_ago , as if it were just a L_required M_coda to her L_tour of L_China ."
a7w-fragment01,60,"When the L_Prince and L_Princess of L_Wales L_quite L_rightly M_scrapped their L_tour of the L_mainland , they had the L_opportunity to M_make a M_contrasting M_point in L_Hong L_Kong ."
a7w-fragment01,61,"Unless they can L_say L_something L_relevant in the M_next four L_days , the L_many L_Hong L_Kong L_critics who L_believe the L_visit is a M_waste of L_dollars will be L_absolutely L_right ."
a7w-fragment01,62,"It did not L_help at all that upon L_arrival L_yesterday the L_royal L_couple L_instantly M_touched M_base in that L_comforting M_symbol of L_past L_British M_power , the L_Hong L_Kong and L_Shanghai L_Bank ."
a7w-fragment01,63,If there is a M_failure of L_imagination to L_use the L_royal L_visit L_creatively it will L_also be a M_failure of L_nerve .
a7w-fragment01,64,L_Britain L_still can not M_decide when to M_play the L_mandarinate M_game of L_silence with the L_Chinese and when to M_break the M_rules ( as L_Beijing does all the L_time . )
a7w-fragment01,65,"The L_ideal M_tactics should be a M_mixture of both , but only if a M_clear M_message can be M_communicated to the L_Hong L_Kong L_people that L_someone is M_standing up for them L_somewhere ."
a7w-fragment01,66,L_Instead the L_latest L_developments in L_Sino-British L_relations have M_left them L_even more L_confused than before .
a7w-fragment01,67,L_China M_claims that the L_Hong L_Kong L_Government L_recently M_gave a L_written L_commitment to M_limit the L_activities of the L_pro-democracy M_movement in the L_territory .
a7w-fragment01,68,"The L_government M_denies this , but has M_published the L_text of a L_letter from its L_Political L_Adviser to the L_New L_China L_News L_Agency ( L_Beijing 's L_embassy in L_Hong L_Kong ) M_suggesting that it did ."
a7w-fragment01,69,"In a M_tone of M_meek M_appeasement , the L_letter M_draws L_attention to the L_arrest by L_Hong L_Kong L_police of L_anti-China L_demonstrators outside the L_agency 's L_National L_Day L_reception ."
a7w-fragment01,70,It L_also M_reminds L_Beijing that L_permission has been L_refused for L_local L_protesters to L_erect a L_replica L_Statue of L_Democracy on a L_permanent L_site .
a7w-fragment01,71,It L_ends by M_assuring L_Beijing that the L_Hong L_Kong L_Government will have ‘ a M_prudent L_regard for the L_special L_circumstances of L_Hong L_Kong and the L_interests and L_concerns of the L_Chinese L_Government . ’
a7w-fragment01,72,L_Meanwhile the M_flood of L_letters of a very L_different L_sort from L_anxious L_Hong L_Kong L_citizens to this and every other L_newspaper L_office L_continues .
a7w-fragment01,73,"So do the L_Chinese L_press L_statements M_asserting that L_Hong L_Kong is ‘ L_entirely a M_business between L_China and L_Britain ’ and should not be M_discussed , L_formally or L_informally , at any L_international M_forum ."
a7w-fragment01,74,"The only two L_Hong L_Kong L_legislators who L_consistently L_dare to L_speak out , L_Mr L_Martin L_Lee and L_Mr L_Szeto L_Wah , have been L_threatened with M_expulsion from the L_committee now L_drafting L_China 's post-1997 L_Basic L_Law ."
a7w-fragment01,75,Our L_latest L_Foreign L_Secretary has L_yet to L_publicly L_pick up the L_file L_marked L_Hong L_Kong .
a7w-fragment01,76,There is L_still L_endless L_dithering on how M_broad a ‘ M_safety M_net ’ L_Britain will M_extend to its L_citizens .
a7w-fragment01,77,They may L_rightly M_feel that it is all L_really L_rather L_appalling .
a7w-fragment01,78,L_Letters to the L_Editor
aa3-fragment08,213,The L_day L_thrift L_turned into a M_nightmare .
aa3-fragment08,214,By L_Daniel L_John
aa3-fragment08,215,L_GEORGE L_Tyson is not a M_gambling L_man nor does he M_take L_unnecessary L_risks .
aa3-fragment08,216,"He does n't L_smoke or L_drink , and L_even if he L_wanted to , two L_heart L_attacks and a L_by-pass L_operation have M_made the M_decision for him ."
aa3-fragment08,217,"By his own M_account , L_Mr L_Tyson is L_thrifty and L_states L_quite L_proudly that neither he or his L_wife L_Rosie are a M_burden on any M_form of L_social or L_government M_support ."
aa3-fragment08,218,"But that is why , at the L_age of 68 , L_Mr L_Tyson is not L_enjoying what he had L_hoped would be a M_comfortable L_retirement ."
aa3-fragment08,219,"A L_life of M_saving had , by 1985 , M_given them a L_small L_nest-egg of £15,000 on which the L_interest would M_help L_supplement their L_pensions ."
aa3-fragment08,220,"To the L_Tysons , that M_meant L_nothing L_extravagant — just an L_extra £135 a L_month to M_make L_life at M_home in L_South L_Ruislip , L_Middlesex L_easier ."
aa3-fragment08,221,That L_money was L_invested as might be L_expected of the L_Tysons .
aa3-fragment08,222,"And for three L_years , it M_earned its M_return , every L_month ."
aa3-fragment08,223,"Until one L_morning in L_June 1988 when L_George L_Tyson L_turned on the L_radio to L_hear a L_small , L_investment L_business L_called L_Barlow L_Clowes had M_collapsed ."
aa3-fragment08,224,"‘ It was about 8.30am and I was just L_getting L_dressed when it M_came over on the L_news , ’ L_said L_Mr L_Tyson , a L_former L_clerk of L_works at L_Harrow L_council , L_London ."
aa3-fragment08,225,"L_Investors in L_Barlow L_Clowes since 1985 , the L_Tysons had L_orginally M_put £10,000 into the L_UK L_fund and £5,000 in L_Gibraltar-based L_Barlow L_Clowes L_International ( L_BCI ) ."
aa3-fragment08,226,"L_Fate L_determined that a M_short while before the L_businesses M_failed , they M_transferred the £10,000 to L_BCI because of the L_better M_returns being L_offered ."
aa3-fragment08,227,"In the L_days that M_followed , the L_Tysons M_found that they and 18,000 other L_investors had been the M_victims of a L_financial M_crash of L_global L_proportions ."
aa3-fragment08,228,"Of the £190million L_invested in both L_funds , L_BCI L_investors M_faced a L_shortfall of up to £100million ."
aa3-fragment08,229,"After the L_initial M_shock and L_disbelief , the L_Tysons L_grew L_angry — at the L_advisers who L_convinced them about L_Barlow L_Clowes , at the L_Midland L_bank L_manager who M_gave L_verbal L_assurances of its M_security , at the L_regulatory L_authorities M_responsible for the L_investment M_community and at the L_Department of L_Trade and L_Industry which M_allowed the L_company to L_trade ."
aa3-fragment08,230,"‘ I M_felt it was so M_safe , they were so L_professional , ’ L_said L_Mr L_Tyson ."
aa3-fragment08,231,‘ I M_feel L_appalled by the M_way these L_professional L_guardians have L_treated us .
aa3-fragment08,232,"If you were a M_gambling L_man it would not L_affect you , it would just be M_lost ."
aa3-fragment08,233,But this was not a M_gamble . ’
aa3-fragment08,234,"Like so L_many L_investors , L_Mr L_Tyson M_found himself having to L_go L_back to L_work to M_ease the L_financial M_strain he had L_hoped to M_avoid ."
aa3-fragment08,235,"L_Ironically , it was the L_Government which he L_partly L_blamed for the L_affair that M_gave him the L_chance to M_return to L_work after L_retirement ."
aa3-fragment08,236,"A L_change in the L_tax L_rules L_affecting L_pensions was L_shortly M_followed by a L_job with the L_Department of L_Environment 's L_Property L_Services L_Agency , a L_post which L_carries him through to L_March and may M_see him M_stay until he is 70 ."
aa3-fragment08,237,"M_Putting it as L_politely as he can , L_Mr L_Tyson L_said the M_whole L_affair ‘ M_encouraged ’ him to M_return to L_paid L_employment ."
aa3-fragment08,238,‘ I had n't M_planned to L_work at all . ’
aa3-fragment08,239,"And like all of the other L_investors , he and his L_wife were in a L_quandry ."
aa3-fragment08,240,They L_wanted to do L_something but M_felt L_powerless .
aa3-fragment08,241,M_Pursuing L_legal L_action would have L_cost them L_money they did n't have ( unless it M_meant L_selling their L_house which was not an L_option ) but doing L_nothing M_left them with the M_feeling that L_justice was n't being done .
aa3-fragment08,242,So they L_compromised and L_gave £100 to the L_Barlow L_Clowes L_Investors L_Group which was M_formed L_last L_July to M_represent the L_investors ' L_interests and M_co-ordinate the M_fight for L_compensation .
aa3-fragment08,243,"That , L_says L_Mr L_Tyson , has been their only M_blessing ."
aa3-fragment08,244,‘ They are L_dedicated L_people who L_clearly L_know what they are M_talking about and have M_guided us through it .
aa3-fragment08,245,"Those L_people are M_victims , too , but they have L_certainly M_kept us M_together . ’"
aa3-fragment08,246,"That M_aside , the L_last L_year has M_brought L_little L_respite from their own , very L_personal , M_crisis ."
aa3-fragment08,247,The L_Tysons have L_yet to L_see any L_cash L_payment from the L_liquidators who have been M_winding up L_BCI 's L_affairs .
aa3-fragment08,248,What L_little L_money has been L_recovered L_remains the M_subject of a L_legal M_tussle in the L_courts which may L_yet M_take L_months to L_resolve .
aa3-fragment08,249,"They have been L_told that their L_claim may only L_amount to M_around £11,000 of their £15,000 as L_capital L_gains L_tax is L_likely to be L_deducted from the L_total ."
aa3-fragment08,250,"But until they L_get any L_money L_back , the L_Tysons M_find themselves in the M_position of the M_gambler who M_gambled all and M_lost ."
aa3-fragment08,251,Except that the L_Tysons do n't M_gamble .
ahc-fragment61,1252,L_Travel : A M_pilgrimage M_sans M_progress L_Elisabeth de L_Stroumillo L_potters L_round L_Poitou
ahc-fragment61,1253,By L_ELISABETH L_DE L_STROUMILLO
ahc-fragment61,1254,L_PEOPLE L_tend to M_look M_vague when you L_mention L_Poitou .
ahc-fragment61,1255,‘ L_Umm … not a M_part of L_France we L_know … where L_exactly is it ? ’
ahc-fragment61,1256,"L_Inland of L_La L_Rochelle , you L_say ; L_north of L_Cognac and L_east of L_Limoges ."
ahc-fragment61,1257,"You L_sort of L_pass it without L_realising , L_going to the L_Dordogne ."
ahc-fragment61,1258,‘ Ah yes — L_Cognac .
ahc-fragment61,1259,L_Nice is it ? ’
ahc-fragment61,1260,"L_Well , L_better than that , and one of the L_best M_things about it is the L_fact that so few L_people , except the L_French themselves , L_bother with it ."
ahc-fragment61,1261,"L_Even for L_France , the L_variety to be M_found is M_enormous ."
ahc-fragment61,1262,"My L_passion is for its L_numerous L_Romanesque L_churches , in most L_cases M_humbly L_proportioned but M_elevated into L_unique L_works of L_art by the L_richness of their L_exquisitely-sculpted L_decoration ; to L_go to Poitou/Saintonge and not L_look at any of its L_churches would be like M_going to an M_African M_game M_reserve and M_ignoring the M_animals ."
ahc-fragment61,1263,"For M_serious L_drinkers there is the L_production of L_cognac to L_investigate around L_Cognac , plus the L_chance to L_sample L_pineau , the M_powerful L_local L_aperitif L_made from M_young L_wine M_laced with L_cognac ."
ahc-fragment61,1264,"To the L_north , where L_Poitou M_borders on the L_Vendee , L_shapely M_clumps of L_trees are L_almost the only M_punctuation M_marks on L_widespreading L_marshy L_landscapes ; to the L_south it M_bubbles with M_little L_rolling L_hills ."
ahc-fragment61,1265,"L_Water is L_everywhere : L_canals , L_streams , L_small M_busy L_rivers with L_charming L_names like the L_Boutonne , the L_Mignon and the L_Belle , and L_big M_lazy L_rivers like the L_Sevre L_Niortaise and the L_Charente ."
ahc-fragment61,1266,"The L_lower L_reaches of the L_Sevre L_Niortaise are L_swollen with the L_waters that once L_covered the L_whole L_area , until L_medieval L_monks L_started to L_dig a M_spider-web of L_ditches to L_drain it ."
ahc-fragment61,1267,"Now the L_Marais L_Poitevin is a L_pleasantly M_low-profile L_tourist L_attraction where you can M_take L_canal-boat M_trips from L_villages that have L_hardly L_changed in the 15-odd L_years I 've L_known them : L_Maillezais , with a L_huge and L_rather M_dull L_ruined L_abbey , and L_Coulon , where I L_first L_ate the L_delicious L_local L_version of moules marinieres L_called L_mouclade ."
ahc-fragment61,1268,"M_Drifting between L_grassy L_polders to which L_farmers have to L_ferry their L_cattle in L_punts , or M_following L_leafy M_twisting L_lanes M_marked only by L_rusty L_signs M_proclaiming the ‘ L_Venise L_Verte ’ , you 're in an L_all-green , L_mysteriously M_silent M_world ; only the L_occasional L_fisherman , L_twitching his L_rod above the M_algae-smothered L_waters , M_disturbs the L_stillness ."
ahc-fragment61,1269,"There is more L_greenery further L_south in the L_deep L_forest of L_Chize ( with the M_fine L_Renaissance L_chateau of L_Dampierre-sur-Boutonne at its L_edge ) ; and more L_marshes to the L_west around L_Rochefort and L_Marennes , where those L_mussels and L_oysters are M_raised ."
ahc-fragment61,1270,One of the L_region 's L_strangest L_townlets M_sits on those L_marshes : L_Brouage .
ahc-fragment61,1271,"M_Somnolent now within its L_low L_grey L_walls and L_stumpy L_towers , it was once M_rich on L_salt , and M_powerful to L_boot ."
ahc-fragment61,1272,"It had a M_son to be M_proud of : L_Samuel L_Champlain , L_founder of L_Quebec , who was L_born there around 1569 ."
ahc-fragment61,1273,"A L_century L_later , it had an M_adoptive M_daughter to M_weep for : 20-year-old L_Marie L_Mancini , L_niece of L_Louis L_XIV 's L_minister L_Mazarin ."
ahc-fragment61,1274,She L_went there when her L_romance with the L_young L_king was M_quashed for L_political L_reasons .
ahc-fragment61,1275,"L_Months L_later , when L_Marie had L_departed , L_Louis is L_said to have L_paused L_nostalgically at L_Brouage on his L_way to L_Paris after L_marrying the L_Spanish L_Infanta at L_St L_Jean-de-Luz ."
ahc-fragment61,1276,"As you L_come L_back from L_Brouage towards L_St Jean-d'Angely — on the D18 via the L_canalside L_village of Pont-l'Abbe-d'Arnoult , with a L_lovely L_Romanesque L_church faade — a L_sign at the L_junction of the D122 M_points you to the L_chateau whose L_improbably L_perfect L_lake and L_gardens M_stare at you from L_posters throughout the L_region : L_La L_Roche L_Courbon ."
ahc-fragment61,1277,"Its most L_surprising L_room , L_covered from L_ceiling to L_floor in 17th-century L_paintings , should be a L_salon or L_library ; L_instead , a L_dotty L_stone L_bathtub was L_set into one L_wall at a L_later L_date by a L_lady L_called L_Charlotte ."
ahc-fragment61,1278,"She L_never L_used it , having M_got some of the L_plumbing M_details L_wrong ."
ahc-fragment61,1279,"M_Wriggling across L_country on the D216 to Port-d'Envaux , you L_come to two more L_chateaux : 18th-century L_Panloy , L_flaking L_romantically M_away on its L_hillock L_overlooking a L_bend in the L_Charente and , L_almost M_next M_door , the L_much L_older , L_moated L_Crazannes , M_half-smothered in L_amazing L_flamboyant L_Gothic L_carving ."
ahc-fragment61,1280,L_Crossing the L_autoroute and L_turning L_north on the D127 M_brings you to L_St Jean-d'Angely by L_way of the L_isolated L_church of L_Fenioux .
ahc-fragment61,1281,"Its L_conically-roofed L_tower , M_hugged about by a M_brood of L_smaller L_roofs L_shaped like M_candle M_snuffers , is L_visible for L_miles ."
ahc-fragment61,1282,"L_St Jean-d'Angely is a L_charming L_little L_town : there are L_good L_shops as L_well as L_half-timbered L_houses along its L_narrow L_old L_streets , one L_spanned by an L_ancient L_bell-tower ."
ahc-fragment61,1283,"There 's L_also a L_Renaissance L_fountain , and an L_extremely M_odd L_conglomeration of L_church L_buildings L_comprising one L_ancient L_ruin , one L_proper L_church , and the M_skeleton L_faade and L_nave of a L_rather M_pompous and L_unfinished 18th-century L_abbey ."
ahc-fragment61,1284,"It M_makes a L_conveniently L_central M_hub : the L_Marais L_Poitevin L_village of L_Coulon is 27 L_miles to the L_north by the D120 , which L_inexplicably M_changes its L_number at the L_top of a L_hill to D115 ."
ahc-fragment61,1285,L_Niort is about the same L_distance by the L_parallel N150 .
ahc-fragment61,1286,"L_Saintes , with L_Gallo-Roman L_remains , a L_beautiful L_Romanesque L_abbey and an M_atmospheric L_medieval L_quarter , is 17 L_miles L_south of L_St L_Jean ; 15-odd L_miles to the L_north-west is L_Surgeres , all of whose L_public L_buildings , L_including an L_engagingly L_asymmetrical L_church , are within the 16th-century L_castle L_walls , L_scattered among L_beautiful L_gardens and parkland — L_perfect for L_picnicking ."

al2-fragment16,177,The 10 p.c. L_gain since L_election L_day is M_looking L_increasingly L_sustainable .
al2-fragment16,178,"It is not that M_prospects for L_earnings are 10 p.c. L_better that they were in the M_middle of L_last L_week , but it is L_possible to L_argue that M_prospects are that L_much L_better than they would have been under a L_Labour L_government and that the M_market was M_discounting such a L_result ."
al2-fragment16,179,The L_FT-SE M_failed to M_hold its L_gains L_yesterday but L_shortly after M_opening it was only six M_points M_away from L_last L_September 's L_previous L_record L_closing M_level .

al2-fragment16,181,The L_City M_view is that the M_fall in L_corporate M_earnings has M_stopped and that M_next L_year 's L_increase could be around 15 p.c .

b17-fragment02,170,L_PART 2 L_Sociology and L_crime
b17-fragment02,171,L_Explaining L_crime : L_theories of L_criminality
b17-fragment02,172,Most L_people have their own L_notions or L_theories as to what L_causes L_criminal L_behaviour .
b17-fragment02,173,"For L_example , L_lack of L_discipline in the L_home , L_genetic L_defects , L_poverty , M_mixing with the ‘ L_wrong L_sort ’ have all been L_proposed as L_causes of L_criminality ."
b17-fragment02,174,"While such L_notions may all M_contains some M_elements of L_truth , they are by no L_means L_complete L_explanations of L_criminal L_behaviour ."
b17-fragment02,175,This L_chapter will M_examine a M_range of L_theories which M_attempt to L_explain such L_behaviour .
b17-fragment02,176,"Although the L_major L_theoretical L_explanations are M_covered in the L_numerous M_introductions to the L_sociology of L_crime and L_deviance and to L_sociology L_generally , some L_review of these L_theories is L_necessary before M_embarking upon an L_examination of L_specific , L_substantive L_examples of L_criminal L_behaviour ."
b17-fragment02,177,"As this is not a L_book on L_criminological L_theories , what M_follows will be a M_brief L_overview of a M_wide M_range of L_theories and L_explanations ."
b17-fragment02,178,"L_First , a L_word of L_warning might be in M_order ."
b17-fragment02,179,"It would be L_naive to L_expect to M_uncover any L_ultimate L_explanation or L_basic L_cause for L_criminal L_behaviour , L_given the M_extensive and L_diverse L_behaviour that is M_encompassed by the L_term L_crime ."
b17-fragment02,180,"L_Suppose , for L_example , that it could be L_proved that one L_cause of L_delinquency was L_lack of L_parental L_supervision ."
b17-fragment02,181,It might L_still be L_necessary to L_ask why L_delinquency L_occurred with one L_son or L_daughter but not another .
b17-fragment02,182,"L_Also , there would be the further L_question of why the L_parents had not L_provided L_adequate L_supervision ."
b17-fragment02,183,L_Perhaps this was because of their M_poor L_living L_conditions which would M_raise the L_question of why they were in M_poor L_housing .
b17-fragment02,184,Was this because of L_governmental L_housing L_policy or a M_poor L_employment L_record on the L_part of the L_bread-winner of the L_family ?
b17-fragment02,185,"M_Clearly , we are M_getting further and further M_away from the L_causes of L_delinquent L_behaviour , and it is L_perhaps L_wisest to L_think in L_terms of L_causal L_processes when M_looking at L_criminal L_behaviour ."
b17-fragment02,186,L_Biological and L_psychological L_theories
b17-fragment02,187,"Before L_examining the L_major L_sociological on L_crime , it is L_useful to L_refer to L_theories from M_outside of L_sociology , from other L_academic L_disciplines ."
b17-fragment02,188,"L_Thus , we will M_look L_initially at L_biological and L_psychological L_theories ."
b17-fragment02,189,L_Biological L_theories
b17-fragment02,190,L_Biological ( or L_physiological ) L_explanations are M_based on the L_notion that some L_individuals are L_predisposed to L_criminal L_behaviour because of their L_genetic M_make-up .
b17-fragment02,191,"The L_individual L_criminal is L_born so ; and this is L_usually M_put down to ‘ L_faulty L_chromosome M_patterns ’ , or , more L_vaguely , to ‘ M_hereditary L_traits ’ ."
b17-fragment02,192,"The most L_famous L_exponent of this M_approach was the L_nineteenth-century L_Italian L_physician , L_Cesare L_Lombroso ."
b17-fragment02,193,"In his L_book L'Uomo L_Delinquente , L_Lombroso L_developed a L_complex L_description of what he M_called the ‘ L_born L_criminal ’ , who could be L_recognised by a L_variety of L_physical L_characteristics , in L_particular L_facial L_characteristics — for L_example L_large L_jaws and L_ears , and L_high L_cheek L_bones ."
b17-fragment02,194,In the L_medical L_faculty at the L_University of L_Rome there is a L_gallery of L_portraits of L_splendidly L_ugly L_delinquents who were L_used to M_illustrate L_Lombroso 's L_theory .
b17-fragment02,195,To L_use his own L_language :
b17-fragment02,196,"L_Thus were L_explained L_anatomically the L_enormous L_jaws , L_high L_cheek L_bones , L_prominent L_superciliary M_arches , M_solitary L_lines on the L_palms , L_extreme L_size of the M_orbits , M_handle-shaped or M_sessile L_ears M_found in L_criminals , M_savages and L_apes , L_insensibility of L_pain , L_extremely M_acute L_sight , L_tattooing , L_excessive L_idleness , L_love of L_orgies and the L_craving for L_evil for its own L_sake …"
b17-fragment02,197,These L_explanations M_see the L_delinquent L_individual as L_inherently more M_prone to L_criminal L_behaviour than the L_non-delinquent .
b17-fragment02,198,They have been L_widely L_criticised and L_rejected by L_sociologists .
b17-fragment02,199,"L_Lombroso 's L_work , for L_example , was M_based on his L_examination of L_people in L_prison in L_Italy ."
b17-fragment02,200,"This would , L_necessarily , M_ignore the L_fact that L_many L_criminals do not L_go to L_prison , and that , L_perhaps , L_people in L_prison are not L_always L_criminal ."
b17-fragment02,201,"Most M_advocates of L_biological L_theories do not M_express themselves in the same L_bizarre L_language and L_style as L_Lombroso , and such L_theories of L_crime are not L_merely L_historical M_relics that M_died with L_Lombroso ."
b17-fragment02,202,"In a L_major L_study of L_institutionalised L_delinquents ( L_delinquents in some M_form of L_custody ) in the L_USA in the 1950s , L_Sheldon and L_Eleanor L_Glueck M_found that L_delinquent L_boys were L_twice as L_likely to have a L_mesomorphic L_build , a L_chunky , L_muscular , L_compared with L_non-delinquent L_boys ."
b17-fragment02,203,"L_However , the L_fact that the L_study was M_restricted to L_institutionalised L_delinquents L_limits the L_validity of the M_association between L_body L_build and L_crime and L_delinquency ."
b17-fragment02,204,It may be that M_tougher-looking L_delinquents are more L_liable to be M_put M_away than M_fragile L_looking L_ones .
b17-fragment02,205,"L_Furthermore , it has been M_found that the M_association between L_delinquency on the one M_hand and L_height , L_weight and L_physique on the other is L_greatly M_reduced once L_social , M_background L_factors are M_taken into M_account ."
b17-fragment02,206,"For L_example , M_lower L_working-class L_people are more L_likely to be L_mesomorphic as a L_result of their L_diet and L_continual L_manual L_labour , and this L_class L_grouping is more L_likely to be M_found L_represented in the L_criminal L_statistics ."
b17-fragment02,207,"With L_regard to the M_links between L_criminal L_behaviour and M_inherited L_characteristics , there have been a L_number of L_theoretical L_explanations M_suggesting an M_association between L_criminality and L_particular L_personality L_characteristics ."
b17-fragment02,208,"An L_example of this more M_sophisticated L_biological M_approach is the L_work of L_Hans L_Eysenck , who has L_argued in a L_series of L_studies , that there is a M_link between L_genetically L_based L_personality L_characteristics and L_criminal L_behaviour ."
b17-fragment02,209,He M_maintains that there is a M_link between L_characteristics such as L_extroversion and L_criminal L_behaviour .
b17-fragment02,210,"An L_individual 's M_degree of L_extroversion or L_introversion is M_inherited , M_determined by his or her L_genetic M_make-up ."
b17-fragment02,211,"The M_link with L_crime M_found by L_Eysenck was that when L_prisoners were L_tested for L_extroversion , more L_extroverts were M_found than in the L_general L_population ."
b17-fragment02,212,L_Eysenck then L_argues that L_extroversion is the M_inherited L_basis of L_criminal L_behaviour .
b17-fragment02,213,"L_Extroverts M_take L_longer to L_learn the M_rules of L_society , they are more L_likely to M_break them , and L_thus more L_likely L_become L_convicted L_criminals ."
b17-fragment02,214,"As with L_Lombroso 's L_work and the L_Gluecks ' L_study L_discussed above , by L_starting with L_institutionalised L_criminals , it is M_assumed that all L_prisoners are L_criminals and that most L_criminals do , in L_fact , L_go to L_prison ."
b17-fragment02,215,The L_people who L_get L_caught and L_imprisoned may not be a L_representative M_picture of all L_criminals .
b17-fragment02,216,The L_major L_problem M_faced by L_theories M_suggesting a M_link between L_genetic M_make-up and L_criminal L_behaviour is the L_difficulty of L_distinguishing between L_genetic and L_environmental L_effects .
b17-fragment02,217,"While some L_genetic L_influence can not be L_ruled out , just what is M_inherited L_remains very L_unclear ."
b17-fragment02,218,L_Psychological L_theories
b17-fragment02,219,These L_theories M_share L_certain L_similarities with L_biological L_explanations .
b17-fragment02,220,They M_stress the M_link between L_criminal L_behaviour and L_specific L_personality L_traits or L_characteristics .
b17-fragment02,221,"L_Psychological L_theories , L_however , M_see these L_characteristics as a L_result of L_unusual or L_abnormal L_experiences , L_rather than as M_inherited ."
b17-fragment02,222,"L_Thus , as with L_biological L_theories , L_crime is M_seen as L_pathological ( a L_disease ) , as L_something to be M_looked at from the L_medical M_point of M_view ."
b17-fragment02,223,"L_However , L_psychological L_causes are L_seen as L_treatable , whereas L_biological L_causes M_mark the L_individual for L_life ."
b17-fragment02,224,"In those L_cases there is no L_possible L_treatment , one is L_born a L_criminal ."
b17-fragment02,225,"L_Many L_psychological L_theories M_refer to L_faulty L_parent-child L_relationships , such as L_abnormal L_experiences in L_early L_childhood having a L_lasting L_effect and L_influence on L_personality ."
b17-fragment02,226,"L_Studies in this M_area have M_indicated that too M_strict or too M_lax L_parental M_attitudes L_increase the L_risk of L_delinquency ( the L_work of L_John L_Bowlby , for L_example ) ; they have M_found that if a L_young L_child is L_deprived of M_close L_personal L_relationships with L_parents or L_parent L_figures then ‘ L_problem L_behaviour ’ is more L_common ."
b17-fragment02,227,"It is L_well L_established that in the L_delinquent-prone , L_home L_discipline is more L_liable to be too M_lax , L_strict or L_erratic ."
b17-fragment02,228,"L_However , it is L_patently L_obvious that L_parents can be a L_good or L_bad L_influence and L_example for their L_children , and this L_fact can L_hardly be L_used to M_explain L_present M_patterns of L_crime ."
b17-fragment02,229,"The L_majority of L_offenders do not L_come from M_disturbed or M_broken L_homes , and L_many M_broken L_homes do not M_produce L_delinquents ."
b17-fragment02,230,"Of L_course , this L_last M_point does not M_show that there is no M_link between L_parent-child L_relations and L_crime and L_delinquency ."
b17-fragment02,231,"The L_problem with M_assessing the L_influence of L_parental and L_family M_dimensions , such as M_weak L_supervision or L_parental L_criminality , is the L_fact that they are M_closely M_linked to L_various M_aspects of L_social and L_economic L_disadvantage , such as L_poverty , L_overcrowding and M_poor L_housing ."
b17-fragment02,232,"And it may be that these L_disadvantages L_help to L_cause L_parental L_difficulties , and M_hamper L_good L_parenting ."
b17-fragment02,233,"We can L_hardly do L_justice to the M_wide L_scope of L_psychological L_theories here , but there are some L_basic L_ideas and L_assumptions which L_underlie such L_theorizing ."
b17-fragment02,234,"These M_stress the L_importance of L_family L_relationships and L_upbringing during the L_early L_years , and M_conclude that L_anti-social , and by L_implication L_criminal , L_behaviour L_results from L_faulty L_personality L_development ."
b17-fragment02,235,"To L_summarise , these L_biological and L_psychological L_theories M_hold that the L_criminal is a L_particular L_type of L_person , L_apart from the M_rest of L_society and with a L_special L_predisposition toward L_criminal L_behaviour ."
b17-fragment02,236,"They are M_based on the L_idea that L_criminal L_behaviour is L_either M_inherited or a L_consequence of L_unique , L_individual L_experiences ."
b17-fragment02,237,"Before we M_look at L_sociological L_explanations it might be L_useful to L_ask yourself , or to L_discuss with L_colleagues , whether you M_feel that L_criminals are L_different ‘ L_types ’ of L_person ."
b17-fragment02,238,"While there are , no L_doubt , L_predispositions toward L_criminal L_behaviour , and L_clearly L_certain L_characteristics are M_inherited , most L_sociologists would L_reject these ‘ L_individual L_pathology ’ L_sort of L_theories ."

b17-fragment02,246,"In L_Chapter One , it was M_stressed that L_crime can not be M_considered L_aside from its L_social M_context , that it is L_dependent on L_society L_defining L_certain L_actions as L_criminal , and on the M_reaction of L_others to such L_actions ."
bmw-fragment09,2543,L_CHAPTER L_NINE
bmw-fragment09,2544,"‘ I have a very L_important L_assignment for you , L_Paula , ’ L_Arlene L_Frampton-Cox L_said ."
bmw-fragment09,2545,"She L_inserted a L_Du L_Maurier L_cigarette into her L_long L_tortoiseshell L_holder and L_sat L_back , L_looking at L_Paula , who was L_seated in the L_visitor 's L_chair on the other L_side of the L_desk , L_long L_legs L_crossed L_elegantly ."
bmw-fragment09,2546,"L_Paula L_looked every L_inch a M_model these L_days , L_Arlene L_thought with a M_touch of M_proprietorial L_pride ."
bmw-fragment09,2547,"Her L_long L_hair , M_shining M_gold , was L_swept L_back and M_caught at the L_nape of her L_neck with a M_bow , M_make-up , L_expertly L_applied , L_accentuated the L_classically L_beautiful M_lines of her L_face , and she L_wore her L_well-cut L_suit with all the L_panache that was L_expected of her ."
bmw-fragment09,2548,"A L_good L_suit was a L_working M_model 's M_uniform — L_Paula now L_bought two each L_season and L_wore them with L_perfectly L_matching L_accessories , L_hat , L_bag and L_shoes ."
bmw-fragment09,2549,This L_one was in M_soft M_light L_green with a M_boxy L_shaped L_jacket and L_narrow L_skirt and the same L_green-and-white L_check L_material of the L_little L_sleeveless L_blouse had been L_used to M_line the L_jacket and M_face the L_wide L_reveres .
bmw-fragment09,2550,"L_Paula 's L_bag and L_shoes were L_patent L_black L_leather , her L_gloves L_white , and she L_carried a L_long L_walking L_umbrella L_neatly L_furled in its L_fur-trimmed L_case ."
bmw-fragment09,2551,"L_Perfectly M_groomed from L_head to L_toe and with all that L_assurance , she was L_ready to L_take on the M_world , L_Arlene L_thought with L_satisfaction , for she M_looked on L_Paula as her very own M_creation ."
bmw-fragment09,2552,"The M_raw M_materials might have been there before — L_indeed , had n't it been she , L_Arlene , who had M_spotted them ?"
bmw-fragment09,2553,But the L_transformation of a L_leggy L_young M_filly into a L_sleekly L_beautiful M_racehorse had been her doing .
bmw-fragment09,2554,eighteen L_months on the M_model M_circuit had M_eliminated all M_trace of her L_former L_Somerset L_accent .
bmw-fragment09,2555,She had L_listened to L_Arlene 's own L_voice and L_set about M_imitating it for she M_held her L_mentor in the M_highest L_esteem whilst L_still being a L_little L_afraid of her .
bmw-fragment09,2556,"The L_House of L_Mattli is M_expanding from L_couture into L_ready-to-wear and one of the M_big L_Bristol L_stores , L_Taylors , are M_putting on a L_show to L_publicise the L_fact that they will be L_stocking the L_new prêt-è-porter ' , L_Arlene L_explained ."
bmw-fragment09,2557,‘ I have been L_asked to M_supply the M_models and I would L_like you to be one of them . ’
bmw-fragment09,2558,‘ Mattli ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2559,"L_Paula L_repeated , L_impressed ."
bmw-fragment09,2560,The L_House of L_Mattli was a L_husband and L_wife L_team who were L_numbered amongst the M_top ten L_names in the L_Incorporated L_Society of L_London L_Fashion L_Designers .
bmw-fragment09,2561,"L_Furthermore L_Madame L_Mattli was a L_Frenchwoman , an L_accident of L_birth which L_added to her L_glamour , for was not L_Paris the L_fashion M_capital of the L_world ?"
bmw-fragment09,2562,"‘ L_Madame L_Mattli will be L_coming to L_Bristol herself , ’ L_Arlene L_continued ."
bmw-fragment09,2563,‘ L_Taylors have a L_certain L_amount of L_stock but she will be L_bringing L_extra L_samples from L_London L_especially for the L_show .
bmw-fragment09,2564,I only L_want the L_best of my L_girls on this L_job .
bmw-fragment09,2565,"Madame Mattli , L_remember , is L_used to the L_best ."
bmw-fragment09,2566,We ca n't M_afford any L_sloppiness .
bmw-fragment09,2567,"I can L_count on you , L_Paula , I M_feel L_sure . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2568,"‘ Oh yes , ’ L_Paula L_said , M_brimming with M_suppressed L_excitement ."
bmw-fragment09,2569,‘ You can L_count on me ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2570,"L_Madame L_Mattli was L_almost L_exactly as L_Paula had L_imagined she would be , a L_petite L_perfectly L_turned out L_woman with an M_air of L_chic that was L_unmistakably L_French ."
bmw-fragment09,2571,"Her M_dark , grey-streaked L_hair , which she L_wore in a L_long L_bob , had been L_cut by L_Vidal L_Sassoon and she L_wore a L_beautifully L_tailored L_black L_suit M_relieved only by a L_little L_white L_flounce at the L_neckline ."
bmw-fragment09,2572,In the L_fitting L_rooms at L_Taylors she L_fussed and L_fretted over her M_creations like a M_mother M_hen and though L_Paula was L_overawed by the L_great L_designer she L_also L_liked her on L_sight .
bmw-fragment09,2573,"L_Madame L_Mattli might be a L_stickler for L_detail , with a M_generous M_helping of the L_artistic L_temperament which L_kept her M_tight-coiled as a M_spring and which would M_explode into L_frenzy if the L_smallest L_detail was not as it should be , but she L_also had a M_kind L_face and M_deep M_perceptive L_eyes ."
bmw-fragment09,2574,"L_Half L_way through the L_day 's L_programme of L_shows , while the L_dressers L_went off to L_grab a L_sandwich and the L_model L_girls , who would not L_dare to L_eat while they were L_showing , M_revived themselves with L_cups of L_black L_coffee , L_Madame L_Mattli L_took L_Paula to one L_side ."
bmw-fragment09,2575,"‘ L_Little L_one , I would L_like to L_speak with you . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2576,L_Paula 's L_stomach M_turned a M_somersault .
bmw-fragment09,2577,Had she done L_something L_wrong ?
bmw-fragment09,2578,"‘ I have been L_watching you L_work , ’ L_Madame L_Mattli L_said M_directly ."
bmw-fragment09,2579,Her L_accent L_reminded L_Paula of L_Louise — L_perhaps that was why she M_warmed to her in L_spite of the L_fact that she was so L_awe-inspiring .
bmw-fragment09,2580,‘ You are L_exactly L_right for a L_couture M_model .
bmw-fragment09,2581,You have all the L_physical L_attributes . ’
bmw-fragment09,2582,"‘ L_Thank you , ’ L_Paula L_said L_faintly ."
bmw-fragment09,2583,L_Madame L_Mattli L_waved a M_dismissive L_hand .
bmw-fragment09,2584,‘ Do not L_thank me .
bmw-fragment09,2585,I am not L_saying this to M_make your L_head M_swell .
bmw-fragment09,2586,On the L_contrary .
bmw-fragment09,2587,The L_fact is that I have a L_vacancy M_arising for a L_couture M_model .
bmw-fragment09,2588,I L_believe you are L_exactly what I am M_looking for .
bmw-fragment09,2589,I would L_like you to L_come to L_London to L_work for me . ’
bmw-fragment09,2590,"Over Madame Mattli 's L_shoulder L_Paula could L_see L_Arlene L_watching her , a L_tiny L_smile M_lifting one M_corner of her L_scarlet L_mouth , and L_Paula L_knew her L_well L_enough by now to L_know L_exactly what she was L_thinking ."
bmw-fragment09,2591,"She did not L_want to M_lose L_Paula , who was one of her L_best M_models , but L_already she was L_enjoying the M_reflected M_glory that M_came from having L_personally L_trained a L_house M_model for one of the L_great L_London L_couture L_houses ."
bmw-fragment09,2592,She had L_known about the L_vacancy at L_Mattli and L_hoped that the L_job might be L_offered to L_Paula .
bmw-fragment09,2593,It was the M_seal of L_approval for her own L_judgement .
bmw-fragment09,2594,‘ L_Well ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2595,L_Madame L_Mattli L_demanded .
bmw-fragment09,2596,‘ Can I have a L_little L_time to L_think it over ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2597,L_Paula L_asked L_boldly .
bmw-fragment09,2598,‘ A L_little .
bmw-fragment09,2599,But L_please do not L_delay too L_long .
bmw-fragment09,2600,My M_present L_house M_model L_leaves at the M_end of the L_month and there are L_plenty of L_girls who would M_jump at the L_chance . ’
bmw-fragment09,2601,‘ I 'm L_sure .
bmw-fragment09,2602,"But all the same I could n't M_make such a M_move without M_giving it some L_thought , ’ L_Paula L_said L_grandly ."
bmw-fragment09,2603,But inside she was M_bubbling with L_excitement .
bmw-fragment09,2604,L_Time to L_think ?
bmw-fragment09,2605,She did n't L_need a L_single L_second .
bmw-fragment09,2606,The L_moment L_Madame L_Mattli had L_offered her the L_job she had M_made up her L_mind .
bmw-fragment09,2607,She was L_going to M_take it — of L_course !
bmw-fragment09,2608,"A L_month L_later L_Paula , L_smartly L_dressed in a L_new L_tweed L_suit with the L_obligatory L_matching L_bag and L_shoes , and L_lugging both her M_modelling L_case and a L_brand L_new L_cream L_leather L_suitcase , M_took the L_train to L_London to L_begin her L_new L_career ."
bmw-fragment09,2609,She had L_booked herself a L_bed at a L_YWCA L_hostel for the L_time being .
bmw-fragment09,2610,"It was not L_quite what she L_envisaged for herself but it had the L_advantage of being L_cheap and it M_went some M_way towards L_satisfying L_Grace , who was L_convinced that L_London was a M_den of L_iniquity M_waiting to L_swallow up her L_unsuspecting L_daughter ."
bmw-fragment09,2611,"From the L_hostel it was only a L_short L_tube L_ride to L_South L_Audley L_Street where L_Madame L_Mattli had her L_showrooms — L_yet another L_advantage , L_Paula L_thought , L_trying to L_weigh up the M_points in L_favour of the L_hostel , which she L_hated on L_sight ."
bmw-fragment09,2612,"L_Sharing a L_small L_spartan L_room with two other L_girls — L_Northerners whose L_accent L_Paula M_found L_almost L_incomprehensible and with whom she had L_nothing in L_common , L_making L_breakfast in the L_communal L_kitchen , L_queuing for the L_bath , M_adhering to a M_strict L_curfew after which L_time the L_doors were L_locked and L_bolted — L_none of these were L_restrictions L_Paula had the M_slightest L_intention of L_enduring for L_long ."
bmw-fragment09,2613,But for now it would have to do .
bmw-fragment09,2614,"And at L_least she was in L_London , M_centre of the L_British L_fashion M_industry ."
bmw-fragment09,2615,"As for the L_House of L_Mattli , it might have been in a L_different M_world to the L_hostel , with its M_air of being a M_cross between a M_workhouse and a M_boarding M_school ."
bmw-fragment09,2616,The L_first L_time she L_rang the L_bell and L_went in through the L_front L_doors of the L_elegant L_old L_house where the L_showrooms were L_situated ( L_Mattli had no L_rear L_entrance ) L_Paula L_felt she was L_stepping into the L_place of her M_dreams .
bmw-fragment09,2617,"M_Deep L_carpet L_covered the L_floors and the L_stairs M_swept up to the L_showrooms and the M_warren of L_workrooms beyond , and though the L_window L_drapes and L_furnishings were L_ever-so-slightly M_faded , as if they had M_seen L_better L_days , they were of the L_finest L_silks and L_velvets and every L_corner was L_swept , L_polished and L_cleaned L_daily so that no L_single L_speck of L_dust , L_let L_alone a L_cobweb , M_dared M_show itself ."
bmw-fragment09,2618,"The L_showroom was neither L_large nor L_small , L_decorated in L_muted M_shades of L_aubergine which would not L_detract from the L_clothes ."
bmw-fragment09,2619,There was a L_low L_table and three or four L_dainty L_chairs with L_aubergine L_velvet L_seats and L_gilded L_spindle M_legs .
bmw-fragment09,2620,"The L_crystal L_chandelier was for L_effect only — L_lighting that would L_show off the L_clothes to their L_best L_advantage was L_brilliant L_yet M_discreet , and along one L_wall were L_racks L_holding some of the L_ready-to-wear L_garments ."
bmw-fragment09,2621,In L_contrast to this L_elegant L_frontage the L_workrooms beyond were a M_hive of L_frenzied L_activity .
bmw-fragment09,2622,"L_Pattern L_cutters , L_fitters , L_sewing L_hands and their L_assistants all L_worked at an L_incredible L_speed ."
bmw-fragment09,2623,"This , L_Paula L_soon M_discovered , was the M_way of the L_fashion M_world — a M_constant L_frantic L_rush against the L_clock , to have L_collections M_ready on L_time or to L_complete L_individual L_couture L_garments for L_customers who L_always L_considered their M_order more L_urgent , more L_important , than that of L_anyone L_else ."
bmw-fragment09,2624,L_Paula was L_amazed by the L_security L_arrangements that were L_necessary to L_ensure that the L_new L_season 's L_collections L_remained L_exclusive — the L_windows at the L_rear of the L_premises were L_heavily L_barred and L_practically the L_first M_thing she had to do on L_commencing her M_employment was to L_sign a L_contract L_promising that she would not M_breathe a L_word about the L_designs she L_saw .
bmw-fragment09,2625,On her L_second L_day L_Madame L_Mattli L_took her to L_Vidal L_Sassoon 's L_salon in L_Grosvenor L_House so that her L_hair could be L_cut in an L_up-to-the-minute L_style .
bmw-fragment09,2626,Unlike some L_couturiers L_Madame did not L_mind if her M_model L_girls did not have the same L_colour L_hair but she did L_insist on L_identical L_styles .
bmw-fragment09,2627,By the L_time L_Vidal L_Sassoon had L_finished with her L_Paula 's L_long M_fair L_locks had been L_shorn to a M_sharp L_geometric L_shape and she L_scarcely L_recognised the L_reflection that M_looked M_back at her from the L_mirror .
bmw-fragment09,2628,"Among the L_rich and L_famous who had L_come to the L_salon to have their L_hair L_cut , L_tinted and L_set , L_Paula L_recognised L_Dusty L_Springfield , the L_pop L_singer , her L_eyes L_big and M_sooty , her L_lips L_pearly L_pink , and was L_unable to M_suppress the L_thrill of L_excitement which M_ran through her ."
bmw-fragment09,2629,This was her very L_first M_taste of only the L_best being L_good L_enough — and she L_liked it !
bmw-fragment09,2630,"It was L_Paula 's L_job to L_show L_samples , L_parading L_slowly up and down in L_front of the L_clients as they L_sat on the L_elegant L_spindle-leg L_chairs M_taking in every L_detail of the L_garments with a M_critical and M_practised L_eye ."
bmw-fragment09,2631,"L_Sometimes they L_came L_alone , L_sometimes with a L_man in M_tow — to M_foot the M_bill !"
bmw-fragment09,2632,L_Paula L_guessed .
bmw-fragment09,2633,"The L_appearance of a L_famous L_face in the L_show L_rooms L_always L_caused a M_stir amongst the L_girls , who all L_longed to M_hook a L_wealthy L_husband — and if he had a L_title , like the L_Aly L_Khan , or was a L_film L_star like L_Omar L_Shariff , then so L_much the L_better !"
bmw-fragment09,2634,"Not L_everything that L_Paula had to do was L_quite so L_glamorous , L_however ."
bmw-fragment09,2635,"In the M_long L_hours when there were no L_customers to L_show she was L_expected to M_lend a M_hand with some of the L_unskilled L_tasks — M_running L_errands and L_making L_tea , L_unpicking a L_seam or a L_hem , L_even L_sewing on a L_button or a L_hook and L_eye when she had been L_taught the L_proper M_way to do it ."
bmw-fragment09,2636,L_Paula was not very L_clever with her L_needle but she L_soon L_learned to be L_careful so as not to L_incur the L_wrath of the L_seamstress .
bmw-fragment09,2637,"There were L_new L_tricks of M_modelling to be L_learned too — how to L_remove a L_coat , L_sliding It L_carefully off her L_shoulders with the L_sleeves L_hanging in L_perfect L_balance , L_never for one L_moment L_allowing the L_inside to be on L_view , for L_samples were L_often L_unlined ."
bmw-fragment09,2638,"This M_trick M_took L_hours of L_practice , up and down the L_landing at the L_hostel while the other L_girls L_looked at her as if she had M_taken M_leave of her M_senses ."
bmw-fragment09,2639,Although she L_enjoyed her L_job L_Paula was L_lonely .
bmw-fragment09,2640,L_Even the most L_popular of L_girls L_soon L_discovered that in this L_highly L_competitive M_world where M_models L_vied with one another for the most L_glamorous L_jobs and the L_wealthiest and L_best-looking L_men there was L_far more L_bitchiness than in the L_provinces — and L_Paula was L_far from L_popular .
bmw-fragment09,2641,The other L_girls L_disliked her for her L_outstanding L_looks and her L_haughty M_ways and M_made no L_attempt to be L_friendly on L_anything but the most L_superficial M_level and the L_pattern L_cutters and L_sewing L_hands L_hurried L_home to their L_families and L_boyfriends the L_moment they L_finished their M_long L_day 's L_work .
bmw-fragment09,2642,"L_Paula M_spent most of her M_free L_time L_alone , L_window L_shopping , L_visiting L_News L_Theatres , where she L_sometimes L_watched the L_programme of L_cartoons L_twice M_round , and L_drinking L_endless L_cups of L_Espresso L_coffee in cafés and L_coffee L_houses ."
bmw-fragment09,2643,Her L_favourite was the L_coffee L_shop in L_Fenwicks in L_Bond L_Street for this was the L_haunt and the L_meeting L_place of all those from the M_world of L_fashion .
bmw-fragment09,2644,One L_lunchtime when she had been at the L_House of L_Mattli for a few L_months L_Paula L_went there for her L_usual L_coffee and the L_cottage L_cheese L_salad that was her L_staple L_diet now that it was so L_important that she did not L_add a L_single L_half-inch to her M_wand-slim L_figure .
bmw-fragment09,2645,"She L_took her L_tray to the L_pay L_desk , L_opened her L_bag and L_felt for her L_purse ."
bmw-fragment09,2646,It was not there .
bmw-fragment09,2647,"L_Frantically she M_rooted L_round , then L_checked her L_pockets without L_success ."
bmw-fragment09,2648,‘ I 'm L_sorry .
bmw-fragment09,2649,I L_seem to have L_lost my L_purse … ’ she L_explained .
bmw-fragment09,2650,The L_girl behind the till L_stared at her L_stonily .
bmw-fragment09,2651,L_Paula was L_going L_hot and L_cold by now .
bmw-fragment09,2652,Had it been L_stolen ?
bmw-fragment09,2653,"No , she L_remembered her L_bag L_tipping over in the L_cloakroom at Mattli — it must have L_fallen out then ."
bmw-fragment09,2654,But without it she could not L_pay for her L_coffee and L_salad .
bmw-fragment09,2655,‘ Having L_trouble ? ’ a L_voice beside her M_asked .
bmw-fragment09,2656,‘ Do n't M_worry .
bmw-fragment09,2657,L_Let me . ’
bmw-fragment09,2658,"L_Paula L_turned L_gratefully , then L_gasped with L_surprise as she L_recognised the L_slight L_figure in L_black L_roll-neck L_sweater and L_skin L_tight L_pants ."
bmw-fragment09,2659,‘ I do n't L_believe it !
bmw-fragment09,2660,L_Gary L_Oliver !
bmw-fragment09,2661,What are you doing here ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2662,"‘ The same as you I L_expect , Paula — M_getting my L_strength up to M_face the L_rest of the L_day ."
bmw-fragment09,2663,"L_Let me L_pay and then we 'll have L_lunch L_together and do some M_catching up — unless you 're L_meeting L_someone , of L_course . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2664,"‘ No — no , I 'm not . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2665,"L_Paula L_picked up her L_try and L_moved L_aside L_waiting for him , L_flushed with L_pleasure at L_seeing a L_familiar L_face ."
bmw-fragment09,2666,"L_Gary L_Oliver was a L_designer , L_young and very L_talented ."
bmw-fragment09,2667,"She had L_met him M_back M_home in the L_west L_country when he had L_come to L_supervise a L_show M_put on by one of the M_big L_ready-to-wear L_labels , L_Carnega , for whom he L_worked as a M_junior M_member of the M_design L_team ."
bmw-fragment09,2668,"For a M_whole L_week they had L_worked M_closely L_together , L_sharing L_flasks of L_coffee and L_packets of L_cigarettes and L_Paula had M_grown to L_like the pixieish L_little L_man who by his very M_nature M_offered her no M_challenge — and no M_threat ."
bmw-fragment09,2669,"L_Gary should have been a L_girl , she had L_thought , for he was half a L_head L_smaller than she was with M_fair L_curling L_hair , L_baby-blue L_eyes and L_long L_thick L_lashes that were the L_envy of every L_woman who L_met him ."
bmw-fragment09,2670,‘ L_Shall we L_sit over there in the L_corner ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2671,L_Gary L_suggested .
bmw-fragment09,2672,"He L_led the L_way , his L_slim L_hips in the L_tight L_fitting L_pants L_snaking L_gracefully between the L_tables ."
bmw-fragment09,2673,They M_unloaded their L_trays on to a L_table .
bmw-fragment09,2674,"‘ What are you doing in L_London then , L_Paula ?"
bmw-fragment09,2675,"L_Apart from L_mislaying your L_purse , I L_mean . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2676,He L_grinned at her L_impishly .
bmw-fragment09,2677,She L_told him .
bmw-fragment09,2678,‘ And what about you ?
bmw-fragment09,2679,Are n't you with L_Carnega any more ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2680,He L_shook his L_head .
bmw-fragment09,2681,L_Dimples M_played in his L_cheeks .
bmw-fragment09,2682,‘ No — now I 'm with the L_House of L_Oliver . ’
bmw-fragment09,2683,‘ The L_House of L_Oliver … ?
bmw-fragment09,2684,Oh ! ’ she L_squealed as M_light M_dawned .
bmw-fragment09,2685,‘ Your own L_house ?
bmw-fragment09,2686,"You 've M_set up as a L_designer in your own M_right , L_Gary ! ’"
bmw-fragment09,2687,‘ L_Yep .
bmw-fragment09,2688,"In a M_small M_way at the L_moment , of L_course , but M_things are L_happening ."
bmw-fragment09,2689,I M_came into a M_bit of L_money when my L_grandmother L_died and I L_decided to M_put it to L_good L_use . ’
bmw-fragment09,2690,‘ Is n't it a M_bit of a L_risk ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2691,L_Paula L_asked .
bmw-fragment09,2692,He L_shrugged his L_narrow L_shoulders .
bmw-fragment09,2693,‘ L_Perhaps .
bmw-fragment09,2694,But I L_wanted to L_work for myself .
bmw-fragment09,2695,L_Designing L_clothes for L_Carnega was all very L_well and I M_made a L_good L_living at it I wo n't L_deny but I L_wanted to be L_free to do my own M_thing — and to have my own L_name on the L_labels .
bmw-fragment09,2696,I have L_quite a few M_contacts — L_people who L_knew me when I was L_designing for Carnega — and they have been very L_encouraging .
bmw-fragment09,2697,So I have L_decided to L_move to L_London and M_open a L_showroom .
bmw-fragment09,2698,"In L_fact I have just been L_looking at a L_place in L_South L_Audley L_Street , not L_far from L_Mattli ."
bmw-fragment09,2699,"If it L_works out we shall M_practically be L_neighbours , L_Paula . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2700,‘ What a L_small L_world !
bmw-fragment09,2701,"I had no L_idea , ’ L_Paula L_said , L_surprised she had not L_already L_heard the L_news ."
bmw-fragment09,2702,L_Usually the M_slightest L_whisper M_travelled like M_jungle M_drums through the M_world of L_fashion .
bmw-fragment09,2703,"Until now L_Gary had been an L_out-of-town L_designer , of L_course ."
bmw-fragment09,2704,But if he was M_moving to L_London his L_new L_fashion L_house would L_soon be a L_talking L_point .
bmw-fragment09,2705,"‘ We must M_keep in M_touch , ’ L_Gary L_said as he L_finished his L_cheese L_roll ."
bmw-fragment09,2706,‘ L_Promise you 'll L_look in and L_say hello when you have L_time . ’
bmw-fragment09,2707,‘ I will .
bmw-fragment09,2708,L_Apart from L_anything L_else I M_owe you a L_coffee . ’
bmw-fragment09,2709,‘ L_True .
bmw-fragment09,2710,I do n't L_suppose I could L_persuade you to L_work for me in M_return ?
bmw-fragment09,2711,I 'm M_looking for a L_couple of L_good M_models .
bmw-fragment09,2712,Though I do n't L_suppose I could L_afford to L_pay you as L_well as L_Mattli does — L_yet .
bmw-fragment09,2713,L_Maybe one L_day … ’
bmw-fragment09,2714,L_Paula L_laughed .
bmw-fragment09,2715,‘ I do n't L_earn that L_much !
bmw-fragment09,2716,By the L_time I 've L_paid for my L_room at the L_YWCA and L_bought all the L_make-up and L_clothes I L_need there L_never L_seems to be L_anything L_left over .
bmw-fragment09,2717,I 'm M_looking for a L_rich L_husband to M_take me M_away from it all . ’
bmw-fragment09,2718,‘ And I 'm L_sure one L_day you 'll L_find him .
bmw-fragment09,2719,"In the L_meantime , do n't L_forget your L_friends , eh L_Paula ? ’"
bmw-fragment09,2720,"‘ I wo n't , ’ she L_promised , L_glancing at her L_watch ."
bmw-fragment09,2721,"‘ Oh M_hell , I shall have to L_go . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2722,‘ Me too .
bmw-fragment09,2723,"But it was M_great to L_see you again , L_Paula . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2724,"They L_walked M_back to L_South L_Audley L_Street L_together , M_weaving their L_way through the L_lunchtime L_crowds on the L_pavements , the L_tall , L_striking L_girl and the L_young L_man whose pixieish M_looks L_belied his twenty-six L_years ."
bmw-fragment09,2725,Outside the L_front L_entrance of the L_House of L_Mattli L_Paula L_turned to M_give him a M_quick L_impulsive L_hug .
bmw-fragment09,2726,"‘ L_Thanks for the L_lunch , L_Gary ."
bmw-fragment09,2727,And L_good L_luck with your L_new L_venture ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2728,"She L_held up her L_fingers , M_tightly L_crossed for him ."
bmw-fragment09,2729,He L_grinned .
bmw-fragment09,2730,‘ I 'll L_need it .
bmw-fragment09,2731,"Do n't L_forget to L_come and L_see me , will you ?"
bmw-fragment09,2732,I shall be L_expecting you . ’
bmw-fragment09,2733,‘ I wo n't L_forget .
bmw-fragment09,2734,"'Bye for now ! ’ she L_called , and L_ran in through the L_imposing L_front L_door ."
bmw-fragment09,2735,L_Madame L_Mattli was L_furious .
bmw-fragment09,2736,In all the L_time she had been with her L_Paula had L_never L_seen her so L_angry .
bmw-fragment09,2737,"‘ I L_hear you have been L_seen L_going into the L_House of L_Oliver , ’ she L_said , her M_immaculately M_painted L_lips M_tight with L_fury ."
bmw-fragment09,2738,"Beside her L_Monsieur L_Mattli , a L_small L_Greek-looking L_man , some ten L_years her L_senior , was L_also L_quivering with L_indignation ."
bmw-fragment09,2739,"‘ Not once but L_several L_times , ’ he M_added ."
bmw-fragment09,2740,It was so L_unusual for him to M_contribute L_anything to the L_conversation that L_Paula L_glanced at him in L_surprise .
bmw-fragment09,2741,"Though he was L_always in M_evidence it was L_invariably L_Madame who did all the L_talking , M_giving M_orders , L_fussing around L_clients , so that L_Paula was L_never L_quite L_certain what his M_role was ."
bmw-fragment09,2742,"‘ L_Gary L_Oliver is a L_friend , ’ she L_said M_defensively ."
bmw-fragment09,2743,L_Madame L_Mattli L_snorted L_angrily .
bmw-fragment09,2744,‘ I do not L_pay you to have L_friends in L_rival L_fashion L_houses . ’
bmw-fragment09,2745,‘ He 's not a L_rival … ’
bmw-fragment09,2746,L_Paula M_broke off .
bmw-fragment09,2747,It L_seemed L_ridiculous that a L_newcomer like L_Gary could be any M_threat to a L_well-established L_house like L_Mattli .
bmw-fragment09,2748,But in the L_cut-throat M_world of L_fashion up and L_coming L_designers were to be L_feared — and L_already L_Gary 's L_reputation was M_growing .
bmw-fragment09,2749,"‘ You L_know that we L_insist on M_complete L_loyalty , ’ L_Madame L_Mattli L_continued ."
bmw-fragment09,2750,‘ The L_security of our M_designs is L_paramount .
bmw-fragment09,2751,"Oh L_Paula , how could you ! ’"
bmw-fragment09,2752,‘ But I would L_never L_mention L_anything I have L_seen here ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2753,L_Paula L_protested .
bmw-fragment09,2754,L_Madame L_snorted again .
bmw-fragment09,2755,‘ How can I be L_sure of that ?
bmw-fragment09,2756,L_Even if you do not L_intend to be L_disloyal there is L_always the L_risk that you might be L_careless .
bmw-fragment09,2757,L_Pillow L_talk is the most L_dangerous . ’
bmw-fragment09,2758,‘ L_Pillow L_talk ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2759,"L_Paula L_repeated , M_stunned ."
bmw-fragment09,2760,M_Close though her L_friendship with L_Gary had L_become she had L_never once M_breathed a L_word to him about the L_new L_collections she L_saw M_taking M_shape at Mattli — and as for ‘ L_pillow L_talk ’ the L_notion was L_absurd .
bmw-fragment09,2761,There was L_nothing like that between them and L_never would be .
bmw-fragment09,2762,L_Gary was not L_interested in L_girls .
bmw-fragment09,2763,L_Surely that must be L_obvious to L_everyone who L_met him .
bmw-fragment09,2764,"‘ You must L_stop L_visiting him , ’ L_Madame L_said M_firmly ."
bmw-fragment09,2765,‘ Either I have your M_word on It or I am L_afraid you can no L_longer L_remain in my L_employ .
bmw-fragment09,2766,I L_want you to L_promise me here and now that you will not L_see L_Gary L_Oliver again . ’
bmw-fragment09,2767,L_Paula was L_trembling .
bmw-fragment09,2768,Her L_job with the L_House of L_Mattli was her M_life .
bmw-fragment09,2769,But to L_allow herself to be M_dictated to in this M_way when she L_knew she had done L_nothing L_wrong was L_tantamount to M_admitting L_guilt .
bmw-fragment09,2770,And she could n't M_bear the L_thought of being M_sucked M_back into the M_ebb M_tide of L_loneliness again L_either .
bmw-fragment09,2771,With L_Gary she M_enjoyed a L_relationship she had L_never L_experienced with L_anyone L_else — the L_easy-going L_friendship of a L_male who M_made no L_demands whatever on her — and it M_meant more to her than she had L_realised .
bmw-fragment09,2772,‘ I have L_never M_betrayed any L_confidence and I L_never will .
bmw-fragment09,2773,"But you ca n't L_expect me to M_cut myself off from my L_friends , ’ she L_said ."
bmw-fragment09,2774,"‘ I am L_afraid I do L_expect it , L_Paula , in this L_case . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2775,‘ I ca n't L_promise not to L_see L_Gary again . ’
bmw-fragment09,2776,‘ Very L_well . ’
bmw-fragment09,2777,There was a M_hint of L_sadness now in L_Madame 's L_eyes but her L_mouth was M_set and M_determined .
bmw-fragment09,2778,"‘ I shall be L_sorry to M_lose you , L_Paula ."
bmw-fragment09,2779,You are a L_good M_model and you M_suited me very L_well .
bmw-fragment09,2780,But you M_leave me no L_choice .
bmw-fragment09,2781,L_Please do not L_bother to L_come in again .
bmw-fragment09,2782,I shall L_contact the L_agency for a L_replacement M_immediately .
bmw-fragment09,2783,"And I L_warn you , if any of my M_designs or L_anything like them M_turn up in the L_showroom at the L_House of L_Oliver I shall L_sue — and L_win the L_sort of M_damages that will M_put your L_little L_friend out of L_business for L_good ."
bmw-fragment09,2784,Do I M_make myself M_clear ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2785,L_Paula was L_still L_afraid of L_Madame L_Mattli — and she was L_also M_close to L_tears .
bmw-fragment09,2786,But she was L_determined L_Madame should not be L_aware of either .
bmw-fragment09,2787,"‘ Yes , L_Madame ."
bmw-fragment09,2788,"I 'm L_sorry to M_leave you , but I L_assure you you need not M_worry on that M_score . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2789,"The L_showrooms of the L_House of L_Oliver were L_smaller and L_less L_grand than those at the L_House of L_Mattli but the décor was L_newer and M_fresher , M_pale L_grey L_drapes , L_ultra L_modern L_black L_furniture and a L_great M_deal of L_gleaming L_stainless L_steel ."
bmw-fragment09,2790,"L_Gary was in the L_workroom when L_Paula L_arrived , L_pinning a L_length of M_vibrant L_pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his M_models ."
bmw-fragment09,2791,His L_mouth was L_full of L_pins .
bmw-fragment09,2792,‘ What are you doing here ? ’ he L_asked without L_moving his L_lips .
bmw-fragment09,2793,L_Paula M_perched herself against the L_cutting L_table M_trying to L_look L_nonchalant .
bmw-fragment09,2794,"‘ I 've M_left L_Mattli , ’ she L_said ."
bmw-fragment09,2795,"L_Gary L_stared at her for a L_moment , L_pins M_spewing from his L_mouth and M_catching on the L_front of his L_black L_jersey ."
bmw-fragment09,2796,Then he L_unpinned the L_length of L_chiffon and L_let it L_fall to the L_floor .
bmw-fragment09,2797,"The M_model L_stood L_motionless , L_clad in L_nothing but her L_bra and L_stockings , L_waiting for his L_instructions ."
bmw-fragment09,2798,"‘ We 'll M_leave this for now , L_Claudia ’ , he L_said ."
bmw-fragment09,2799,"‘ M_See if you can L_rustle up a L_cup of L_tea for L_Paula and me , L_please . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2800,The L_girl L_pulled on her L_wrap and L_moved to the L_door L_looking L_back over her L_shoulder as she L_went and L_Paula was L_aware of the L_hostility in her L_gaze .
bmw-fragment09,2801,"Why was it all L_women L_hated her so , L_even when they did n't L_know her ?"
bmw-fragment09,2802,She L_shrugged .
bmw-fragment09,2803,"Oh L_well , she should be L_used to it by now …"
bmw-fragment09,2804,"L_Gary L_got up , L_took L_Paula by the L_arm and L_led her over to the L_low L_sofa ."
bmw-fragment09,2805,"‘ What 's all this about , L_lovey ?"
bmw-fragment09,2806,You ca n't have M_left L_Mattli . ’
bmw-fragment09,2807,‘ I have . ’
bmw-fragment09,2808,L_Paula M_related what had L_happened and L_saw L_Gary L_turn L_pale .
bmw-fragment09,2809,‘ Oh L_Lord !
bmw-fragment09,2810,You L_mean she L_thinks you 've been L_spying for me !
bmw-fragment09,2811,If she L_sues I 'll be M_ruined .
bmw-fragment09,2812,"L_Even L_worse , L_someone of her M_stature could M_make a M_hell of a L_lot of L_trouble for me , L_even if she does n't . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2813,‘ But L_Gary — I have n't been L_spying for you !
bmw-fragment09,2814,I have n't L_even L_mentioned a L_single L_detail of the L_Mattli L_collection . ’
bmw-fragment09,2815,‘ You L_know that and so do I. But L_suppose I 've done L_something L_similar ?
bmw-fragment09,2816,It L_happens every L_season — by M_sheer L_chance and M_law of L_averages some of the L_ideas are M_bound to M_come up .
bmw-fragment09,2817,"There are L_always L_accusations of M_piracy and L_copy-catting , though they ca n't L_usually be L_substantiated ."
bmw-fragment09,2818,But if she can L_prove that you and I … ’
bmw-fragment09,2819,‘ That 's L_nonsense !
bmw-fragment09,2820,We have n't done L_anything L_wrong . ’
bmw-fragment09,2821,L_Gary M_ran a M_distracted L_hand through his M_mop of M_fair L_hair .
bmw-fragment09,2822,‘ You 're L_going to have to L_describe the L_Mattli L_collection to me .
bmw-fragment09,2823,Every L_detail . ’
bmw-fragment09,2824,"‘ L_Gary ! ’ she L_objected , M_shocked ."
bmw-fragment09,2825,‘ You 're an M_original .
bmw-fragment09,2826,You ca n't M_steal their L_ideas ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2827,"‘ No , idiot — not so that I can M_steal them ."
bmw-fragment09,2828,"So that I can M_go through my M_designs and M_make L_quite L_certain that there is not one L_collar , not one L_cuff L_detail , not the M_slightest L_influence that they could L_accuse me of M_copying from them ."
bmw-fragment09,2829,Oh L_Jesus L_Christ ! — L_suppose there 's L_something L_major ?
bmw-fragment09,2830,My L_peg L_top L_evening L_gown — my L_beautiful L_cerise L_lace — I could L_end up having to L_rethink the M_whole L_collection ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2831,‘ For L_goodness L_sake L_stop L_panicking ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2832,"L_Paula L_said , though she could L_feel the M_seeds of L_panic herself ."
bmw-fragment09,2833,‘ I 'm L_sure there 's L_nothing to M_worry about . ’
bmw-fragment09,2834,‘ I only L_hope you 're L_right ! ’ he L_said in M_anguished L_tones .
bmw-fragment09,2835,"The M_model L_came in with the L_cups of L_tea , L_still L_glowering M_darkly at L_Paula from beneath her L_fringe of M_false L_eyelashes ."
bmw-fragment09,2836,It was M_clear she was L_blaming L_Paula L_bitterly for the M_interrupted L_afternoon and her L_boss 's L_drastic L_change of L_mood .
bmw-fragment09,2837,‘ That L_girl is a M_dog ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2838,L_Paula L_said when they were L_alone again .
bmw-fragment09,2839,‘ I 'm L_sure she ca n't do M_justice to your M_designs .
bmw-fragment09,2840,And with a M_miserable L_face like hers I 'm L_surprised you L_ever M_get any L_work done at all . ’
bmw-fragment09,2841,L_Gary L_looked L_crestfallen .
bmw-fragment09,2842,‘ She 's the L_best I could L_get … ’
bmw-fragment09,2843,‘ Oh what M_rubbish ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2844,L_Paula L_said L_roundly .
bmw-fragment09,2845,"‘ L_Anyway , you 've L_got me now so you can M_get M_rid of her . ’"
bmw-fragment09,2846,‘ What do you L_mean ? ’
bmw-fragment09,2847,L_Gary L_asked .
bmw-fragment09,2848,He L_looked like a L_worried L_small L_boy .
bmw-fragment09,2849,‘ I L_told you — I 've M_left L_Mattli .
bmw-fragment09,2850,I 'll L_come and L_work for you . ’
bmw-fragment09,2851,‘ Oh L_Paula ! ’
bmw-fragment09,2852,L_Gary 's M_expression L_became L_even more L_anxious .
bmw-fragment09,2853,‘ You L_know I 'd L_give my L_right L_arm to have L_someone as L_good as you to M_model for me !
bmw-fragment09,2854,But I L_told you before — I could n't L_afford to L_pay you what you 're L_worth .
bmw-fragment09,2855,"L_Well , not for L_ages , L_anyway ."
bmw-fragment09,2856,It 's L_going to be a M_long M_struggle L_getting L_established and until I am I do n't M_see how … ’
bmw-fragment09,2857,L_Paula L_smiled .
bmw-fragment09,2858,For the L_first L_time she L_felt the M_stirrings of L_something like M_power .
bmw-fragment09,2859,It was not unlike the L_feeling she L_experienced when L_men L_looked at her and L_wanted her though she L_knew it could not be that for there was L_nothing L_sexual between her and L_Gary and L_never would be .
bmw-fragment09,2860,"But it was just as L_exciting , L_nevertheless ."
bmw-fragment09,2861,"It M_made her L_feel M_strong , L_invincible L_almost , and just a L_tiny L_bit as if she had M_drunk too L_much M_wine ."
bmw-fragment09,2862,Her L_smile M_spread .
ccw-fragment04,1991,"We M_beat L_southwards all that L_first L_day , M_slicing through a L_glittering L_sea , and L_propelled by an L_apparently L_changeless L_south-easterly L_trade L_wind ."
ccw-fragment04,1992,We L_hardly L_saw the L_Crowninshield L_twins .
ccw-fragment04,1993,"They L_briefly L_appeared on L_deck for L_lunch ; a L_meal which L_Rickie L_hardly L_touched , while L_Robin-Anne , despite her L_apparent L_frailty , M_attacked the L_sandwiches and L_salad with the M_savagery of a M_starving M_bear ."
ccw-fragment04,1994,"L_Afterwards , L_incongruously L_dressed in a L_raincoat , she L_went to the M_bows and L_stared L_briefly down at the L_mesmerising L_onrush of L_sea where it M_split and L_foamed at L_Wavebreaker 's L_cutwater ."
ccw-fragment04,1995,"She did not L_stay there L_long , but M_retreated from the M_fierce L_sun to the L_stern-cabin that she would be L_sharing with L_Ellen ."
ccw-fragment04,1996,"The L_contrast between the two L_American L_girls was L_almost M_painful ; L_Ellen was so L_healthy and L_strong , while the L_waif-like L_Robin-Anne was L_pathetically L_wan and L_listless ."
ccw-fragment04,1997,‘ What do you L_think of her ? ’
ccw-fragment04,1998,I L_asked L_Ellen that L_afternoon .
ccw-fragment04,1999,L_Ellen M_gave me an M_amused L_glance .
ccw-fragment04,2000,‘ M_Little L_Orphan L_Annie ?
ccw-fragment04,2001,It 's M_hard to L_believe she 's about to be M_worth six million L_dollars .
ccw-fragment04,2002,"L_Still , she 's L_got L_precious L_little L_else M_going for her . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2003,I L_smiled at the L_severity of L_Ellen 's L_judgment .
ccw-fragment04,2004,‘ Is she that L_bad ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2005,"‘ She has a L_distressingly L_simple L_mind , with only M_room for a L_single L_idea at any one L_time ."
ccw-fragment04,2006,"L_Presently that L_idea is L_cocaine , and L_nothing but L_cocaine ."
ccw-fragment04,2007,She has an L_obsession with the L_drug that M_verges on L_monomania .
ccw-fragment04,2008,She L_tells me she L_needs to L_understand it if she 's L_going to M_defeat it . ’
ccw-fragment04,2009,‘ Do n't you L_approve of that ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2010,"‘ I L_think she 'd do L_better to L_understand herself , ’ L_Ellen L_said M_tartly ."
ccw-fragment04,2011,"‘ She L_allowed a L_man to L_persuade her into L_taking the L_drug , so she can only L_blame herself for her L_predicament ."
ccw-fragment04,2012,She 'd M_find it more L_useful to L_understand her own L_character short­comings than to M_take an L_elementary M_course in L_drug L_chemistry . ’
ccw-fragment04,2013,‘ What do you M_make of L_Rickie ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2014,I L_asked .
ccw-fragment04,2015,"‘ He 's L_precisely what L_anyone would L_expect of a L_drop-out L_Phys L_Ed L_basketball-playing L_retard , ’ L_Ellen L_said L_scornfully , ‘ by which I L_mean that he 's a L_jock with the L_brains of a M_dung M_beetle ."
ccw-fragment04,2016,"He L_reminds me of your M_Neanderthal L_friend , the Maggot , except L_Rickie is a L_great L_deal more L_handsome . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2017,‘ Is he ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2018,She L_laughed at the L_suspicion of L_jealousy in my L_voice .
ccw-fragment04,2019,"‘ Yes , L_Nicholas , he is ."
ccw-fragment04,2020,But he 's not L_cute . ’
ccw-fragment04,2021,"At L_supper , as at L_lunch , L_Robin-Anne L_ate with the L_appetite of a M_horse , though her L_brother L_hardly L_touched his L_chicken and L_pasta L_salad ."
ccw-fragment04,2022,‘ Do n't you like L_pasta ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2023,"L_Ellen , who was L_perversely L_proud of her L_skills in the L_salad M_department , L_asked L_Rickie with just a M_touch of L_asperity ."
ccw-fragment04,2024,‘ It 's M_great .
ccw-fragment04,2025,L_Really L_awesome . ’
ccw-fragment04,2026,L_Rickie L_lit a L_cigarette .
ccw-fragment04,2027,‘ I just L_guess I 'm not L_hungry . ’
ccw-fragment04,2028,L_Robin-Anne L_reached over and L_tipped her L_brother 's L_food on to her own L_plate .
ccw-fragment04,2029,"‘ L_Kind of M_starving , ’ she L_justified her M_theft , then L_poured herself some L_diet L_soda ."
ccw-fragment04,2030,"For once we were L_carrying neither L_wine nor M_spirits on L_Wavebreaker , for L_Jackson L_Chatterton 's L_drug L_clinic had L_utterly M_forbidden us to L_offer the L_twins any L_alcohol , L_saying that any L_mood-altering L_drug could M_hamper the M_success of a L_detoxification L_programme ."
ccw-fragment04,2031,"We were L_thus L_officially a M_dry L_boat , though I had L_hidden some L_Irish L_whiskey in the L_engine L_room , and I was L_sure that L_Ellen would have L_similarly L_salted L_away some L_vodka ."
ccw-fragment04,2032,"It L_seemed that L_Ellen and I were not the only L_ones to M_take such a L_precaution , for L_late that L_night L_Jackson L_Chatterton L_lumbered on L_deck with a L_bottle in one L_huge L_hand ."
ccw-fragment04,2033,"‘ L_Bourbon , ’ he L_explained L_laconically ."
ccw-fragment04,2034,‘ L_Want some ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2035,‘ I L_thought you 'd L_never L_ask . ’
ccw-fragment04,2036,"He L_chuckled , M_produced two L_cardboard L_cups , and L_poured me a M_generous M_slug of the L_whiskey ."
ccw-fragment04,2037,"We were L_alone on L_deck , though not the only L_ones L_awake for I could L_hear L_Rickie and L_Ellen 's L_voices M_coming from the L_open L_skylight of the L_main L_saloon ."
ccw-fragment04,2038,I L_hoped L_Thessy was L_fast L_asleep for he would be M_taking the L_morning L_watch .
ccw-fragment04,2039,"‘ L_Cheers , ’ I L_said ."
ccw-fragment04,2040,"L_Chatterton L_raised his L_cardboard L_cup in L_silent L_acknowledgement , then L_stared L_ahead to where a L_great M_beam M_swept around the L_sky ."
ccw-fragment04,2041,‘ A L_lighthouse ? ’ he L_asked in a L_voice which M_suggested that a L_prudent L_man L_avoided such L_things .
ccw-fragment04,2042,I L_nodded .
ccw-fragment04,2043,‘ It 's L_called the L_Hole in the L_Wall .
ccw-fragment04,2044,Once we 're past it we can L_turn out to the L_open L_ocean .
ccw-fragment04,2045,M_Things will be a L_bit L_livelier then . ’
ccw-fragment04,2046,‘ L_Livelier ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2047,"‘ We 'll have a L_bit more L_sea , L_kick up some L_spray . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2048,"I had L_spoken L_enthusiastically , but L_Jackson L_Chatterton L_seemed L_unmoved by the M_prospect ."
ccw-fragment04,2049,‘ What are your M_plans ? ’ he L_asked me .
ccw-fragment04,2050,"I had L_nothing L_particular M_planned , L_merely an L_idea that it might be L_interesting to M_thrash our L_way out into the M_open L_ocean , L_though , L_mindful of the L_danger of L_tropical L_storms , I had no L_intention of L_going too L_far from the L_safe L_shelter of a L_Bahamian L_hurricane L_hole ."
ccw-fragment04,2051,"But I L_fancied L_feeling the M_long M_hard L_pressure of L_ocean L_waves against our L_hull and , though we were L_short-handed , I M_reckoned that a few L_days out of L_sight of L_land would M_shake us all down L_quickly ."
ccw-fragment04,2052,"I L_explained all that to L_Chatterton , but M_stressed that we would M_run for M_cover at the L_first M_sign of L_trouble ."
ccw-fragment04,2053,"He must have M_assumed that I L_meant L_trouble from the L_twins , for he L_suddenly L_became L_surprisingly L_loquacious ."
ccw-fragment04,2054,"‘ They wo n't M_give you any M_grief in the M_next few L_days , ’ he L_said ."
ccw-fragment04,2055,‘ Now that they ca n't M_get M_hold of L_cocaine they 'll just L_crash out . ’
ccw-fragment04,2056,I L_grimaced .
ccw-fragment04,2057,‘ Does that M_mean they 'll be L_seeing L_green L_monkeys and L_blue L_snakes up the L_rigging ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2058,"L_Chatterton L_poured himself more L_bourbon , then L_put the L_bottle within my L_reach on the L_binnacle L_shelf ."
ccw-fragment04,2059,‘ M_Coming off L_cocaine is n't like that .
ccw-fragment04,2060,At L_first they 'll just L_want to do L_nothing but L_eat and L_sleep .
ccw-fragment04,2061,"It 's the L_opposite of a L_cocaine M_high , you M_see . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2062,He L_paused .
ccw-fragment04,2063,‘ The L_difficult M_bit L_starts two or three L_days L_later .
ccw-fragment04,2064,That 's when the L_real M_hell L_begins . ’
ccw-fragment04,2065,‘ For all of us ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2066,"‘ It wo n't be L_easy , ‘ he L_said L_grimly , and I was L_suddenly L_rather L_glad to have the L_taciturn L_Chatterton aboard ."
ccw-fragment04,2067,"The L_big L_man had L_obviously L_come on L_deck to L_warn me what to L_expect from the L_twins , and for that I was L_grateful ."
ccw-fragment04,2068,"‘ I L_noticed that L_Rickie was n't L_eating L_today , ’ I L_said , ‘ but L_Robin-Anne was ? ’"
ccw-fragment04,2069,L_Chatterton L_nodded .
ccw-fragment04,2070,"‘ L_Rickie may have L_stopped his L_cocaine a L_day or two L_ago , which M_means he 's L_probably L_already over the M_crash L_period ."
ccw-fragment04,2071,I L_promise you one M_thing ; he 's L_brought L_none of it on L_board .
ccw-fragment04,2072,"I L_searched him and his L_luggage , and he was M_clean . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2073,"The L_big L_man L_thought for a few L_seconds , then L_laughed ."
ccw-fragment04,2074,‘ He 'd L_better be M_clean !
ccw-fragment04,2075,"That M_turkey has M_got one L_chance of L_avoiding L_jail , just one , and that L_chance is by L_proving to the L_judge that he 's M_cleaned up his M_act ."
ccw-fragment04,2076,"And if he does n't do that , then the L_man will L_send L_Rickie 's L_plump L_young ass down to the L_gang-rape M_squad in the L_county L_jail . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2077,L_Chatterton did not L_sound L_unduly L_worried at that M_prospect .
ccw-fragment04,2078,‘ Can we be L_sure L_Robin-Anne did n't L_bring any of the L_drug L_aboard ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2079,I L_asked .
ccw-fragment04,2080,"‘ She wo n't have done that , ’ L_Chatterton L_said with M_conviction ."
ccw-fragment04,2081,"‘ That L_girl is L_serious about L_giving it up , L_real L_serious , M_heavy L_serious !"
ccw-fragment04,2082,That L_girl is L_really L_trying !
ccw-fragment04,2083,"She L_studies the L_drug , you L_know ?"
ccw-fragment04,2084,Like it was her M_enemy . ’
ccw-fragment04,2085,L_Chatterton had L_spoken with L_genuine L_admiration .
ccw-fragment04,2086,"I L_glanced up at the L_sails , down at the L_compass , then L_ahead to where the L_lighthouse M_loom L_arced L_powerfully through the L_night ."
ccw-fragment04,2087,"‘ So what are the L_twins , L_chances ? ’"
ccw-fragment04,2088,"‘ L_Depends on their will L_power , 'cause L_nothing L_else will do it for them ."
ccw-fragment04,2089,"There L_ai n't no L_pill to M_get you off the L_powder , L_Mr L_Breakspear , only will L_power ."
ccw-fragment04,2090,"And L_let me L_tell you , M_coming off L_coke is the M_hardest L_damn M_thing in the L_world , and you 're L_real L_lucky if you have a L_rich L_daddy who L_pays for L_people to M_hold your M_hand while you M_go through the M_hell of it ."
ccw-fragment04,2091,"The L_twins ’ L_daddy has L_paid for you and me , L_Mr L_Breakspear , and for L_everyone L_else on L_board this L_boat , but L_even with all that L_money and all this L_boat , we L_still might not L_succeed with them . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2092,‘ It 's that M_hard ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2093,"‘ It is that M_hard , ’ he L_said L_ominously , and I L_thought of L_John L_Maggovertski 's L_sadness for a L_pretty L_girl who had L_whored herself to L_pay for the L_white L_powder ."
ccw-fragment04,2094,"‘ And it 's L_even M_harder , ’ L_Jackson L_Chatterton 's L_voice was L_suddenly L_sinister , ‘ for a L_poor L_person who has no L_one to L_help them . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2095,"I L_stared at L_Jackson L_Chatterton , and at L_last L_sensed the M_drama that M_lay behind his M_big M_calm L_presence ."
ccw-fragment04,2096,"‘ Why did you L_leave the L_army , L_Mr L_Chatterton ? ’"
ccw-fragment04,2097,I L_asked after a M_long L_pause .
ccw-fragment04,2098,"‘ I L_guess you can L_guess , ’ he L_said ."
ccw-fragment04,2099,"I L_guessed , but did not M_make him L_confirm my L_guess ."
ccw-fragment04,2100,L_Instead I
ccw-fragment04,2101,L_asked whether the L_American L_army had M_helped him to M_kick his L_drug M_habit .
ccw-fragment04,2102,"‘ L_Sure they L_tried , they L_tried L_real M_hard , but M_back then I did n't"
ccw-fragment04,2103,L_want to be L_helped . ’
ccw-fragment04,2104,‘ But you L_still M_got off L_cocaine ?
ccw-fragment04,2105,On your own ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2106,‘ L_Eventually . ’
ccw-fragment04,2107,The L_light inside the L_binnacle M_glossed his L_black
ccw-fragment04,2108,"L_face with a L_sheen of L_red , M_sparking his L_eyes like L_fire ."
ccw-fragment04,2109,"He was not L_looking at me , but L_staring L_doggedly L_ahead into the M_turning L_white L_light of the L_Hole in the L_Wall ."
ccw-fragment04,2110,"‘ And I had to M_lose a L_good , L_good L_woman before I M_came to my L_senses ."
ccw-fragment04,2111,"But I did M_kick the L_drug , L_Mr L_Breakspear , and it was L_probably the M_hardest L_damned M_thing I L_ever did in all my L_life ."
ccw-fragment04,2112,"But once I 'd done it , I L_swore I 'd L_help L_others do it . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2113,‘ L_Even the very L_rich ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2114,I L_asked L_provocatively .
ccw-fragment04,2115,"‘ The L_rich M_trash L_pay the L_bills , L_Mr L_Breakspear , which M_lets me M_give my M_spare L_time M_away to the L_poor M_trash . ’"
ccw-fragment04,2116,"I L_looked at the M_tough , L_impressive L_face ."
ccw-fragment04,2117,‘ Are the L_twins M_trash ? ’
ccw-fragment04,2118,"He L_paused before L_replying , then M_gave the L_smallest L_shake of his L_head ."
ccw-fragment04,2119,"‘ She 's L_OK , but him ? ’"
ccw-fragment04,2120,"This L_time the L_pause was L_almost L_eloquent , then he M_gave a M_richly M_contagious L_laugh ."
ccw-fragment04,2121,‘ I 'd have L_liked to have had L_Rickie L_Crowninshield in my L_platoon for just five L_minutes . ’
ccw-fragment04,2122,I L_laughed too .
ccw-fragment04,2123,‘ L_Good to have you L_aboard . ’
ccw-fragment04,2124,"‘ It L_ai n't L_bad being L_aboard , ’ he L_said , and L_held out his L_hand and , not before L_time , we L_shook ."
ccw-fragment04,2125,"By L_midnight I was L_alone on L_deck , and L_happy to be L_alone ."
ccw-fragment04,2126,I L_like L_sailing L_alone at L_night .
ccw-fragment04,2127,I L_like to L_watch the L_phosphorescence M_curling L_away from the L_hull and I L_like to L_watch the L_brilliant M_specks of L_light M_fade in the L_black L_deep L_water L_far in the L_ship 's L_wake .
ccw-fragment04,2128,"I L_like to be L_alone under the M_careless L_profusion of the L_stars , and L_alone on a L_moon-glossed L_sea ."
ccw-fragment04,2129,I L_like the L_sounds of a L_boat L_sailing at L_night .
ccw-fragment04,2130,"The L_sounds are the same as those of L_daylight , yet L_somehow the L_night M_magnifies and M_sharpens the L_creak of a M_yielding L_block , the M_sigh of L_air over a L_shroud , the L_stretching of a L_sail , the M_hiss of L_water M_sliding M_sleek against the L_hull , the M_curl of a L_quarter-wave L_falling L_away , and the L_thump as a L_wave L_strikes the L_cutwater to be M_sheared into two L_bright M_slices of L_whiteness ."
ccw-fragment04,2131,I L_like the L_purposefulness of a L_boat at L_night as it M_slits a M_path across an L_empty L_planet .
ccw-fragment04,2132,"I L_like the M_secretiveness of a L_boat in the L_blackness , when the only L_thing to L_dislike is the M_prospect of L_dawn , which L_seems like a M_betrayal because , at L_night , in a L_boat under L_sail , it is L_easy to M_feel very M_close to L_God — for L_eternity is all around ."
ccw-fragment04,2133,"I L_tacked the L_ship L_shortly after L_midnight , doing the L_job by myself and L_enjoying the L_work ."
ccw-fragment04,2134,"L_Ellen was L_still L_awake , L_talking in the L_stateroom with L_Rickie , but L_everyone L_else L_seemed L_asleep ."
ccw-fragment04,2135,"I L_wished that L_Ellen and L_Rickie would L_go to their L_beds , for the M_soft L_mutter of their L_voices was an M_intrusion on the L_dark and M_star-studded L_infinity through which I L_steered L_Wavebreaker ."
clw-fragment01,1,The L_School M_Framework
clw-fragment01,2,A Model to M_Link L_Personality L_Characteristics to a L_Preference for L_Science
clw-fragment01,3,L_John L_Head
clw-fragment01,4,M_Introduction
clw-fragment01,5,In L_recent L_years there has been a M_steady L_accumulation of L_evidence that L_personality and L_allied L_affective L_factors M_play a L_crucial M_role in L_determining M_subject L_choice and L_student L_success .
clw-fragment01,6,"L_Unfortunately , this L_evidence has L_tended to be L_fragmentary , a M_collection of M_separate , L_discrete M_pieces of L_information L_lacking a M_synthesizing L_theory to L_provide L_cohesion and L_predictive M_power ."
clw-fragment01,7,The few M_models which have been L_developed to L_date may have been L_correct as M_far as they M_go but are L_clearly L_incomplete .
clw-fragment01,8,"For L_example L_Roe ( 1952 ) , L_Eiduson ( 1962 ) and L_McClelland ( 1962 ) L_suggested that L_male L_scientists L_often L_experienced a M_lonely L_childhood , L_perhaps L_suffering L_social M_isolation through L_illness or L_family L_circumstances , so that they L_developed a M_strong L_interest in their L_surrounding L_material M_world and a below L_average M_interest in other L_people and L_relationships ."
clw-fragment01,9,L_Maslow ( 1966 ) and L_Hudson ( 1966 and 1968 ) M_saw L_science as L_providing an L_emotionally M_undemanding L_activity M_appealing to L_boys M_moving from the L_calm of L_latency to the M_turbulence of L_adolescence .
clw-fragment01,10,"L_Even if these L_descriptions are L_valid they L_still M_leave M_open a L_number of M_questions , L_particularly why the same M_mechanisms do not M_operate with L_girls ."
clw-fragment01,11,M_Arising from the L_evidence in the L_literature and from our L_empirical L_studies at L_Chelsea L_College it is now L_possible to L_offer a M_model which is L_compatible with all the L_evidence and which L_also has L_considerable L_predictive L_potential .
clw-fragment01,12,What we L_know about L_persons L_choosing L_science
clw-fragment01,13,The L_evidence for an M_association between L_personality L_characteristics and an M_interest in L_science has been more L_fully L_reviewed by L_Head ( 1979 ) .
clw-fragment01,14,We L_need now only M_take M_note of the most L_salient M_features .
clw-fragment01,15,The most L_obvious L_one is that of L_sex L_differences .
clw-fragment01,16,"The L_predominance of L_males , L_particularly in the L_physical L_sciences and L_engineering , throughout the L_Western L_world can no L_longer be L_satisfactorily L_attributed to L_cognitive L_differences , which are too M_small , nor to L_institutional L_factors ."
clw-fragment01,17,L_Equal L_opportunity in L_education and L_employment has not M_made L_science any more L_popular with L_women .
clw-fragment01,18,"L_Furthermore , the L_characteristics of those L_students who do L_opt for L_science M_show M_clear L_sex L_differences ."
clw-fragment01,19,"L_Male L_scientists , both L_science L_students and M_mature , L_professional L_scientists , L_tend to be L_emotionally L_reticent , L_disliking L_overt L_emotional L_expression in L_others and themselves , and L_depending upon their L_partners in L_personal L_relationships to M_take the L_emotional L_initiatives ."
clw-fragment01,20,"They will L_also L_tend to be L_authoritarian , L_conservative and L_controlled in their L_thinking ."
clw-fragment01,21,These L_differences can be M_seen L_quite L_early on ; we have M_found L_boys L_aged 14 L_years who were L_opting for L_science to be L_significantly more L_authoritarian than their L_peers .
clw-fragment01,22,"L_Girls L_choosing L_science are not L_particularly L_emotionally L_reticent or M_rigid in their L_thinking , although they do L_seem to have M_low L_self-esteem in L_terms of being L_socially and L_sexually L_attractive ."
clw-fragment01,23,We L_also L_know that at about the L_age of 13 a very M_high M_proportion of L_boys are M_attracted to L_science and L_scientific L_careers .
clw-fragment01,24,"L_Thereafter , there is a M_steady L_decline of M_interest in L_science and this L_disillusionment M_extends L_right through the L_secondary-school L_years and into the L_undergraduate L_period ."
clw-fragment01,25,"In M_contrast , only a L_minority of L_girls M_express an M_interest in L_science at any L_age but there is no L_obvious M_swing from L_science in the M_middle and L_late L_teens ."
clw-fragment01,26,Some further L_evidence has M_come from our L_use of L_sentence L_completion L_tests with L_secondary-school M_pupils as M_part of our L_research L_programme at L_Chelsea .
clw-fragment01,27,L_Analysis of these M_responses L_provides further L_information on L_sex L_differences and between those L_opting for L_different M_subjects .
clw-fragment01,28,"For L_example , L_girls at the L_age of 12 and 14 L_years L_seem to M_take a more M_mature M_attitude to L_personal L_relationships , M_seeing their L_complexity and L_reciprocal M_nature , while L_boys are more L_exploitative ."
clw-fragment01,29,"In L_relation to the L_sentence M_stem ‘ A L_girl and her L_mother … ’ , L_girls L_often M_produce M_responses like ‘ L_often M_go through a L_bad M_patch for a L_year but once they L_learn to L_understand each other , L_become the L_best of L_friends ’ or ‘ can L_help each other with their L_problems ’ ."
clw-fragment01,30,"L_Similar L_questions , when L_asked of L_boys , L_tend to M_produce L_banal L_responses or L_exploitative L_ones , for L_example the L_parent is M_seen as the M_source of L_money ."
clw-fragment01,31,"In M_contrast , L_boys L_seem to have a M_firmer L_self-identity and a M_clearer L_ambition M_showing more L_insight in L_response to L_sentence M_stems such as ‘ My L_main L_problem is … ’ and ‘ He/she M_felt L_proud that … ’ ."
clw-fragment01,32,Such L_findings M_give us some L_clues about the L_characteristics of L_boys and L_girls of these L_ages .
clw-fragment01,33,"If we L_compare L_boys of 14 L_years of L_age who L_opt for L_science with other L_boys , we M_find that the L_former have very L_cut-and-dried M_views on L_many L_issues ."
clw-fragment01,34,"For L_example , they M_take the M_view that ‘ L_criminals should be L_severely L_punished ’ or that ‘ L_anyone who is L_unpopular L_deserves his L_fate ’ ."
clw-fragment01,35,"To the L_sentence M_stem ‘ When a L_child will not M_join in L_group L_activities … ’ , these L_boys M_gave L_responses like ‘ he is L_selfish ’ , ‘ he must be L_stupid ’ , ‘ he L_deserves to be L_unpopular ’ ."
clw-fragment01,36,"In M_contrast , other L_boys and most L_girls L_pondered the L_possible L_causes and M_ways of L_integrating the L_child into the L_group ."
clw-fragment01,37,"The L_science L_boys L_seemed to M_possess few L_doubts or L_uncertainties , they L_offered L_clear-cut L_answers ."
clw-fragment01,38,It was this L_evidence which M_suggested the L_possible M_model for M_subject L_choice in L_terms of L_ego-identity L_achievement .
clw-fragment01,39,L_Ego-identity in L_adolescence
clw-fragment01,40,This M_model was L_originally L_postulated by L_Erikson ( 1965 ) and then L_developed by L_Marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) .
clw-fragment01,41,L_Erikson M_suggests that at L_different M_phases of L_life an L_individual M_faces a L_particular L_psycho-social L_problem which L_needs to be L_resolved before M_moving on to the M_next M_phase .
clw-fragment01,42,For L_adolescents the M_acquisition of a M_clear L_ego-identity is the L_crucial L_task .
clw-fragment01,43,"At the L_beginning of L_adolescence , the L_individual is a within the L_family and the L_school ."
clw-fragment01,44,"By the M_end of L_adolescence he or she L_needs to M_make L_choices about L_career , L_life-style , L_personal L_relationships and L_ideologies ."
clw-fragment01,45,The L_ego-identity of that L_person is M_shaped by these L_choices .
clw-fragment01,46,L_Erikson does not L_suggest that the L_development of an L_ego-identity is a L_once-and-for-all L_issue .
clw-fragment01,47,"Some L_problems about L_identity M_arise with the L_young L_child in the M_context of L_home and L_school , and L_others L_occur in L_later L_life , for L_example on L_retirement ."
clw-fragment01,48,"L_Nevertheless , L_adolescence is the L_time when L_ego-identity L_development L_inevitably M_dominates the L_personal L_development of the L_individual for a while ."
clw-fragment01,49,"The L_adolescent does not , L_however , L_need to L_achieve a M_clear L_ego-identity on all L_topics at one L_time ."
clw-fragment01,50,He or she may have a M_clear L_identity in L_respect to his or her L_career but L_still be L_unresolved in L_regard to L_personal L_relationships and L_ideology .
clw-fragment01,51,In this L_article we are L_concerned with L_ego-identity L_achievement in L_respect to L_career .
clw-fragment01,52,"L_Marcia has M_put more M_detail onto the L_Erikson M_model and L_suggests that in M_going from the L_initial M_ego-diffusion M_condition to that of having L_achieved L_ego-identity , two L_processes are L_involved : M_crisis and L_commitment ."
clw-fragment01,53,M_Crisis in this M_context M_describes a L_period of L_intensive M_self-examination in which L_one 's L_beliefs and M_values are L_re-examined .
clw-fragment01,54,L_Commitment M_means that the L_individual has M_acquired M_clear and M_firm L_beliefs both about himself or herself and the L_world .
clw-fragment01,55,L_Figure 16.1 M_indicates a L_number of L_possible M_routes to L_ego-identity L_achievements .
clw-fragment01,56,"A L_person may L_undergo M_crisis and L_commitment L_simultaneously and M_progress by M_route A. An L_alternative is to L_undergo a L_period of L_considerable L_self-doubt and M_self-examination in which all one 's L_beliefs L_tend to be very M_fluid , a L_period L_known as L_moratorium , before M_acquiring L_beliefs for L_oneself and L_ego-identity is L_achieved ( M_route B ) ."
clw-fragment01,57,"A further L_possibility is that the L_individual may , at L_least for a L_time , M_hold onto L_beliefs and M_values M_taken without L_question from L_others , for L_example L_parents , L_teachers , L_peers ."
clw-fragment01,58,This M_condition is L_known as M_foreclosure .
clw-fragment01,59,"L_Eventually these L_persons might have to L_face up to L_period of M_crisis , of M_self-examination , and so L_achieve L_ego-identity by M_route C. L_However , M_foreclosure does M_offer an M_escape M_route and an L_individual might L_postpone L_indefinitely any L_real M_self-examination by M_clinging M_rigidly to his or her L_beliefs and M_values ( M_route D ) ."
clw-fragment01,60,L_Ego-identity and L_Choosing L_Science
clw-fragment01,61,We can now M_make the M_link between this M_model of L_adolescent L_development and M_subject L_choice in L_schools .
clw-fragment01,62,"For L_boys at the M_foreclosure M_stage , L_science is L_likely to be L_appealing ."
clw-fragment01,63,"The L_physical L_sciences in L_particular , M_offer a L_conventional L_career L_choice which is L_likely to M_win L_approval from L_parents , L_teachers and L_peers ."
clw-fragment01,64,"They will L_tend to M_regard the L_overt L_expression of L_emotions , L_including L_much such L_expression in the L_arts , as being M_soft and L_feminine ."
clw-fragment01,65,"L_Science , with its L_masculine M_image , M_makes L_little L_emotional M_demand on an L_individual and L_seems to M_offer M_clear , L_precise M_answers to L_problems ."
clw-fragment01,66,L_Opting for L_science will M_permit and L_possibly M_reinforce L_emotional L_reticence .
clw-fragment01,67,For a L_girl at the M_foreclosure M_stage the M_situation is very L_different .
clw-fragment01,68,"There is L_evidence that L_girls L_tend to be L_socialized into L_adult M_roles more through their L_potential of L_becoming a L_mother and L_housewife than through their L_career ( L_Douvan and L_Adelson , 1966 ) ."
clw-fragment01,69,"L_Furthermore , these L_girls will L_tend to M_go into a L_career with a L_feminine M_image , one which L_already M_attracts L_many L_girls ."
clw-fragment01,70,"L_Consequently , very few L_girls at the M_foreclosure M_stage will M_enter L_science unless they L_receive L_considerable L_encouragement and a M_model to do so from their L_parents and their L_school ."
clw-fragment01,71,Neither L_boys nor L_girls at the L_moratorium M_stage are L_likely to be M_attracted to the L_science that is L_usually M_presented in our L_schools .
clw-fragment01,72,"They are at a M_stage when they are L_likely to be L_concerned with a L_variety of L_complex L_issues ; the L_meaning of L_life , the L_existence of L_God , L_ideologies , their L_emerging L_sexuality , their L_future L_career and L_life-style — too L_often L_science is M_seen as being L_purely L_instrumental with L_nothing to M_contribute to these L_debates ."
clw-fragment01,73,"L_Science , L_somehow , L_seems to be L_scarcely L_relevant to the most L_important L_issues in our L_life ."
clw-fragment01,74,A M_proportion of both L_boys and L_girls at L_ego-identity L_achievement M_stage will M_choose L_science .
clw-fragment01,75,"In L_fact , most L_girls M_entering L_science are L_probably at this M_stage as they will L_need some M_self-examination and L_sense of L_commitment to M_make this L_unconventional L_choice ."
clw-fragment01,76,"L_However , only a L_minority of L_adolescents will have M_reached the L_ego-identity L_achievement M_stage at the L_age when most M_pupils have to M_make L_crucial L_decisions about M_subject L_choice at L_school ."
clw-fragment01,77,This M_model L_seems to M_explain our M_observations .
clw-fragment01,78,"A M_large L_number of L_boys , L_particularly at the M_foreclosure M_stage , are L_initially M_attracted to L_science but there is a M_drift M_away throughout L_later L_adolescence as they L_undergo some M_crisis ."
clw-fragment01,79,"The L_preponderance of L_boys at the M_foreclosure M_stage will M_yield the M_rigid , L_authoritarian M_attitudes L_often L_associated with L_scientists ."
clw-fragment01,80,The few L_girls who M_enter L_science will not L_usually L_show these M_foreclosure L_characteristics .
clw-fragment01,81,L_Effects of L_Curriculum M_Changes
clw-fragment01,82,The L_real L_use of this M_model M_linking L_personality L_development to M_subject L_choice is that it M_allows us to M_make L_predictions about how M_pupils might M_react to M_changes in L_school L_science L_curriculum and L_school L_organization .
clw-fragment01,83,We can M_consider three L_possible M_changes :
clw-fragment01,84,1
clw-fragment01,85,L_Delaying M_subject L_choice : L_Britain is L_unusual in L_asking M_pupils to M_make L_crucial L_choices about M_subject L_options in the 13–16 L_age M_range .
clw-fragment01,86,These L_decisions can only be M_reversed with M_great L_difficulty .
clw-fragment01,87,What L_effect would L_delaying the L_choice M_make ?
clw-fragment01,88,"In the L_development through the L_years of L_adolescence the L_number of M_foreclosure M_pupils will L_diminish , L_hence the L_recruitment of L_boys into L_science would be M_cut ."
clw-fragment01,89,More L_boys and L_girls will have M_reached the L_ego-identity L_achievement M_stage and a M_proportion of these will M_go into L_science .
clw-fragment01,90,"L_Overall there would be a M_reduction in the L_number of L_students L_choosing L_science , but those who do so L_choose will be more L_likely to M_stay L_happily in the M_subject and to L_possess more M_flexible L_minds ."
clw-fragment01,91,The L_quantitative L_loss would be M_met by a L_qualitative L_improvement .
clw-fragment01,92,2
clw-fragment01,93,"M_Giving L_science a more L_feminine M_image : It is L_sometimes L_argued that L_science L_textbooks are L_sexist in M_showing L_illustrations of L_boys , L_rather than L_girls , doing L_practical L_work in the L_laboratory , and so L_forth ."
clw-fragment01,94,What L_effect would a L_deliberate L_attempt to M_change this M_image have ?
clw-fragment01,95,It might M_make it L_easier for L_girls at the M_foreclosure M_stage to L_accept L_science so L_recruitment might L_increase .
clw-fragment01,96,"Some of these L_girls might , L_however , M_drift M_away again when they M_reach their M_crisis L_period ."
clw-fragment01,97,"Unless the M_change in M_image was L_immense , L_boys would L_probably not be L_affected , L_science would L_still be an L_obvious , L_acceptable L_choice for a L_boy ."
clw-fragment01,98,"L_Overall there would be some L_increase in the L_recruitment of L_girls , but no L_qualitative L_improvement ."
clw-fragment01,99,3
clw-fragment01,100,"M_Emphasizing the M_applications and L_relevance of L_science : To L_obtain a L_major L_qualitative L_improvement to L_recruitment in L_science with more L_girls and with L_students M_possessing L_imaginative , M_flexible L_minds it would be L_necessary to M_make L_science L_appealing to L_boys and L_girls at the L_moratorium M_stage ."
clw-fragment01,101,In that L_event L_science must be M_seen to be L_relevant to the L_issues which L_concern them .
clw-fragment01,102,The L_probable L_implication is that L_science would L_need to be M_presented in the M_context of the L_needs of L_society and L_individuals .
clw-fragment01,103,"L_Probably a L_case-study M_approach L_involving the M_application of L_science , and the M_interaction with other L_disciplines , would be L_needed ."
clw-fragment01,104,Our L_knowledge about the L_girls ' L_concern with L_personal L_relationships M_suggests that the L_introduction of some M_elements of the L_social L_sciences into the L_case L_studies might L_prove M_attractive .
clw-fragment01,105,Is it L_possible to M_change L_school L_science in this M_fashion and L_still M_preserve the L_essential M_character of L_science itself ?
clw-fragment01,106,L_Clearly there would L_need to be some L_drastic M_pruning of L_content .
clw-fragment01,107,L_Perhaps L_science L_teachers should not L_attempt to M_cover their M_subjects so L_comprehensively .
clw-fragment01,108,A L_history L_teacher is L_content to M_cover the L_history of one L_country or L_continent over a few L_decades .
clw-fragment01,109,L_Perhaps we must M_make L_similar L_choices .
clw-fragment01,110,It is L_interesting to L_notice that the L_Association for L_Science L_Education ( 1979 ) L_policy L_statement in L_Britain and the L_proposals on L_school L_physics M_coming from the L_Institute for L_Science L_Education ( L_IPN ) in L_Kiel are M_advocating such M_changes .
clw-fragment01,111,"The L_difference is that we are now L_offering a M_formal L_psychological M_model to L_suggest that if we L_want to M_reduce the L_current M_encapsulation of L_science , if we L_want to M_recruit a L_different L_sort of L_student , then L_certain L_curriculum M_changes are L_needed ."

clw-fragment01,115,Over 90 per L_cent of M_entries in all L_technical M_subjects are from L_boys .
clw-fragment01,116,This M_means that L_schoolgirls are L_ineligible for a M_wide M_range of M_courses in further and M_higher L_education and for M_entry to M_occupations L_requiring a L_scientific or L_technical M_base .
clw-fragment01,117,"L_Female L_exclusion from L_science and L_technology , L_even if it is L_apparently by L_girls ' own L_choice , L_also M_means that as L_citizens their L_ability to L_understand and M_control their L_environment is L_limited ."
clw-fragment01,118,"L_Nevertheless , most L_schools M_consider they are L_already L_providing L_equal L_opportunities by M_neutral L_treatment of the two L_sexes ( L_Bloomfield , 1984 ) ."
clw-fragment01,119,"In L_effect , L_ignoring the L_effects of L_gender in this M_way L_merely M_reinforces L_stereotyping because it does L_nothing to M_challenge the L_definition of L_certain M_aspects of the L_curriculum as L_masculine or L_feminine ."
clw-fragment01,120,"L_Girls Into L_Science and L_Technology ( L_GIST ) was the L_first L_major L_schools-based L_project M_addressing L_problems of L_sex L_stereotyping at L_school , and was an L_example of ‘ L_action L_research ’ in L_education ; the L_project L_simultaneously M_took L_action to L_improve L_girls ' L_achievement in L_science and L_technology and M_investigated the L_reasons for their L_under-achievement ."
clw-fragment01,121,The L_project L_team M_collaborated with L_teachers in eight L_co-educational L_comprehensive L_schools in the L_Greater L_Manchester L_area to L_devise and L_implement L_intervention L_strategies M_designed to L_improve L_girls ' M_attitudes to the L_physical L_sciences and L_technical M_subjects .
clw-fragment01,122,Two other L_schools were L_involved as M_controls where M_attitude L_testing but no L_interventions M_took M_place . …
clw-fragment01,123,The M_approach was L_collaborative : L_teachers were L_invited to L_work with the L_team as L_equal L_partners in the L_attempts both to L_investigate and M_find L_solutions to the L_GIST L_problem .
clw-fragment01,124,"L_However , very few of the L_teachers L_even M_recognized the L_issue as one of L_professional L_concern at the M_start of the L_project , and most of the L_first two L_years was M_spent in L_establishing the L_educational L_importance of the L_issue and L_working towards the L_development of L_feasible L_intervention L_strategies ."
clw-fragment01,125,"The L_project and its L_outcomes have been L_fully L_described M_elsewhere ( L_Smail et al . ,"
clw-fragment01,126,"1982 ; L_Kelly , L_Whyte and L_Smail , 1984 ; L_Whyte in L_press ) ."
clw-fragment01,127,"L_GIST had more L_success in L_altering L_children 's M_attitudes than their M_subject L_choices , L_suggesting that it is L_easier to M_change M_attitudes and L_beliefs than L_actual L_behaviour ."
clw-fragment01,128,M_Pupils in L_action L_schools L_became L_markedly L_less L_stereotyped than M_pupils in M_control L_schools .
clw-fragment01,129,They L_also had L_slightly more L_positive M_attitudes towards L_science and L_scientists and were L_less L_likely to M_define them as L_exclusively L_masculine .
clw-fragment01,130,"Despite some L_evidence of M_change in L_teachers ' M_attitudes and L_behaviour , they themselves were L_reluctant to M_admit that the L_project had L_influenced them ."
clw-fragment01,131,"L_According to an L_evaluation L_report this may M_reflect an L_unwillingness to M_admit that in the L_past L_schools have been L_sex L_biased ( L_Payne , L_Cuff and L_Hustler , 1984 ) ."
clw-fragment01,132,"The L_GIST L_hypothesis was that L_female L_under-achievement in L_science and L_technology is at L_least L_partly L_socially M_constructed by the L_school , an L_hypothesis M_based on L_research L_evidence as L_well as L_critical L_feminist L_analysis ( M_see , for L_example , L_Kelly , 1981 ) ."
clw-fragment01,133,During the L_project there was a M_shift M_away from M_locating the L_issue as one of L_girls ' L_motivation towards L_attempts to M_change the M_nature of L_school L_science .
clw-fragment01,134,"One of the L_main L_gains from the L_GIST L_project has been the L_clarification of what is M_meant by a ‘ L_girl L_friendly ’ , L_science , that is a L_science which will M_appeal L_equally to the M_interests and L_concerns of L_girls as L_well as L_boys . …"
clw-fragment01,135,Making L_Science More L_Girl L_Friendly
clw-fragment01,136,L_Several L_interventions were M_designed to M_make L_science more L_girl L_friendly .
clw-fragment01,137,"L_Schools and L_teachers M_tried L_curriculum L_development to M_build on L_girls ' L_science M_interests , M_changing M_patterns of L_classroom L_interaction , L_single L_sex L_groups and L_classes ."
clw-fragment01,138,"The M_largest M_scale L_intervention was the L_VISTA L_programme , which L_consisted of L_women L_scientists and L_technologists L_visiting L_schools to L_talk to L_children about an M_aspect of their L_jobs L_already being M_covered in the L_school L_science L_syllabus ."
clw-fragment01,139,"L_VISTA M_made L_science more L_girl L_friendly in two M_ways : both L_boys and L_girls were L_offered an M_attractive M_image of a L_competent L_woman L_scientist , and L_talks M_concentrated on L_social and L_industrial M_applications of L_science , an M_element too L_often L_missing from L_science at L_school ."
clw-fragment01,140,One L_school was so L_impressed by the L_children 's L_positive M_reactions that they L_completely L_revamped the L_science L_work in the L_first two L_years to M_include more L_social and L_human M_applications of L_science .
clw-fragment01,141,"The M_survey of L_children 's M_attitudes M_helped here : L_research such as L_Ormerod 's ( 1971 ; L_Ormerod and L_Duckworth , 1975 ) had M_shown that L_girls were L_interested in the L_social L_implications of L_science , but did not L_tell L_teachers what the L_desirable L_teaching M_approach might be in L_practice ."
clw-fragment01,142,Would L_science in the M_home be a M_starter ?
clw-fragment01,143,"A L_question from our M_survey M_asked L_children whether they would L_like to L_know more about how a L_vacuum L_cleaner L_works ; L_hardly L_anyone did , and L_girls were L_even L_less L_curious than L_boys ."
clw-fragment01,144,This M_told us that any L_simplistic L_assumptions about L_featuring ‘ L_female ’ L_domestic M_interests in L_science would L_probably M_meet with L_failure .
clw-fragment01,145,"The L_rest of the L_questionnaire about L_science L_curiosity M_showed that all the L_children were L_enthusiastic about L_learning L_science , and that L_girls were M_keen to L_know more about L_nature , the L_environment and L_medical L_science ."
clw-fragment01,146,"Over 50 per L_cent , and in some L_cases over 60 per L_cent L_said they would L_like to L_learn about the L_human L_heart , L_germs and L_illnesses , how our L_muscles M_work , what L_food is L_good for you , L_life in the L_sea , what M_makes a L_rainbow L_appear and how a L_record is L_made ."
clw-fragment01,147,It was L_helpful that these L_topics L_also L_interested L_boys .
clw-fragment01,148,"At L_present the L_science L_curriculum is M_structured around L_physical L_science M_interests , on which L_boys are M_keener ( how L_motor L_cars M_work , L_atoms and L_molecules ) ; we were L_able to L_recommend that L_teaching M_build on the M_overlapping M_interests of the two L_sexes , because L_girls as L_well as L_boys L_want to L_know more about L_human L_biology and L_spectacular M_features of the L_environment ( L_animals in the L_jungle , L_volcanoes and L_earthquakes , L_acids and L_chemicals ) ."
clw-fragment01,149,"The L_less L_immediately M_attractive M_parts of L_science could be M_approached through these M_interests , for L_instance L_teaching ‘ L_forces ’ by L_beginning with the M_action of L_muscles in the L_human L_arm , and ‘ L_light ’ via the L_dissection of a L_bull 's L_eye ."
clw-fragment01,150,"When L_women L_scientists L_employ such M_approaches , and L_describe their own L_work , as L_happened during the L_VISTA L_programme , L_girls are L_receiving M_double L_encouragement ."
clw-fragment01,151,"These L_examples M_indicate some of the M_features of L_girl L_friendly L_science : it M_builds on L_girls ' M_interests , not just L_boys ' ; it L_explicitly M_encourages L_girls to M_see themselves as L_potential L_scientists , and it M_includes some of the L_social and L_human L_implications and M_applications of L_science ."
clw-fragment01,152,Other L_GIST L_Interventions
clw-fragment01,153,"All the L_GIST L_schools were L_mixed L_comprehensives , and at L_first L_teachers were most L_unwilling to L_separate L_boys and L_girls at all , on the L_grounds that it M_ran L_counter to their L_co-educational L_comprehensive L_philosophy ."
clw-fragment01,154,Then L_certain L_teachers were L_particularly M_struck by the L_evidence of M_large L_differences in the M_interests and L_experience L_children M_brought with them to L_school .
clw-fragment01,155,L_Girls had M_far L_less ‘ L_tinkering ’ L_experience than L_boys and the M_connection with their L_lesser M_interest in L_topics like ‘ how L_electricity is L_produced ’ L_seemed L_obvious .
clw-fragment01,156,L_Several L_special L_science or L_craft L_clubs were L_organized in the L_lunch L_hour for L_girls only and in two L_schools L_teachers M_planned L_single-sex L_teaching .
clw-fragment01,157,"As we shall M_see , it was in these two L_schools that the M_largest L_measurable M_changes of M_attitude and L_option L_choice L_occurred ."
clw-fragment01,158,"For a more L_girl L_friendly L_science , it L_seems M_vital that L_teachers should M_come to M_see that when all the L_masculine M_packaging , L_evident in L_textbooks and M_resources as L_well as L_teachers ' and L_boys ' L_behaviour in the L_classroom , is M_removed , L_girls can be very L_enthusiastic about L_science . …"
clw-fragment01,159,L_Alison L_Kelly M_sees at L_least four M_distinct L_senses in which it can be L_argued that L_science is L_masculine .
clw-fragment01,160,"L_First , the M_pupils , L_teachers and L_practitioners of L_science are L_overwhelmingly L_male in L_terms of L_numbers ; L_second , L_school L_science is M_packaged and M_presented to M_appeal to L_boys , not L_girls ; L_third , L_classroom L_behaviours and L_interaction M_operate to M_reconstruct L_science as a L_male L_activity , and L_finally it has been L_suggested that ‘ L_scientific ’ L_thinking L_embodies an L_intrinsically L_masculine M_world M_view ."
clw-fragment01,161,"The L_GIST L_interventions L_described above L_relate to three of these : L_VISTA L_women , albeit L_briefly and L_temporarily , L_redressed the L_numerical M_balance by L_offering L_female L_role L_models of L_practising L_scientists ; L_VISTA and the L_curriculum L_development which M_followed L_involved a L_limited ‘ M_repackaging ’ of L_science to M_remove its L_exclusively L_masculine M_appeal , and the L_single-sex L_classes and L_classroom L_observation M_showed how L_science M_comes to be M_defined as ‘ L_masculine ’ in the L_mixed L_school ."
clw-fragment01,162,"The L_fourth M_point , the L_idea that L_science is L_intrinsically L_masculine , can be M_sustained only by M_clinging to an L_irredeemably M_narrow L_conception of L_science and L_scientific L_thinking ."
clw-fragment01,163,"The L_industrial and L_social M_impact of L_science on L_health , on L_people , on the L_environment , a M_focus on the L_beauty and L_complexity of the L_natural L_world , are L_notable L_omissions from the L_school L_science L_syllabus ."
clw-fragment01,164,"L_Girls are not L_uninterested in L_science , they are L_bored by the L_limited M_version of it they M_meet in L_school ."
clw-fragment01,165,"One of the L_purposes of an M_extended L_period of L_single-sex L_science L_teaching might be to L_let L_teachers M_see how L_girls M_approach L_scientific L_matters , and to M_discover , what may L_well be the L_case , that L_girls are just as L_capable of ‘ L_scientific L_thinking ’ as L_boys ."
clw-fragment01,166,"L_Margaret L_Spear , in a L_different L_study from the one L_reported in this L_volume , M_found that for L_identical L_work L_boys were L_marked M_higher than L_girls for L_supposed L_understanding of L_principles , L_aptitude for L_science and O L_level L_suitability ( L_Spear , 1984 ) ."

cty-fragment03,459,"Over against the L_German L_army or the L_Vichy L_government , where L_social L_generality M_ruled , as it does in all M_machines of L_state , the L_Resistance M_offered the L_rare L_phenomenon of L_historical L_action which L_remained L_personal ."
cty-fragment03,460,"The L_psychological and L_moral M_elements of L_political L_action were L_almost the only L_ones to M_appear here , which is why L_intellectuals L_least M_inclined to L_politics were to be M_seen in the L_Resistance ."
cty-fragment03,461,"The L_Resistance was a L_unique L_experience for them , and they L_wanted to M_preserve its L_experience in the L_new L_French L_politics because this L_experience M_broke M_away from the L_famous L_dilemma of being and doing , which M_confronts all L_intellectuals in the M_face of L_action … ."
cty-fragment03,462,It is only too L_obvious that this M_balance between L_action and L_personal L_life was M_intimately M_bound up with the L_conditions of L_clandestine L_action and could not M_survive it .
cty-fragment03,463,"And in this M_sense it must be M_said that the L_Resistance L_experience , by M_making us L_believe that L_politics is a M_relationship between L_man and L_man or between L_consciousnesses , M_fostered our L_illusions of 1939 and M_masked the L_truth of the L_incredible M_power of L_history which the L_Occupation M_taught us in another M_connection ."
cty-fragment03,464,"If by 1945 L_Merleau-ponty had here L_already M_indicated the L_historical L_basis for what was to L_become L_Sartre 's L_project in the L_Critique , the L_theoretical L_problem that M_followed was how to M_unite L_orthodox L_Marxist L_concepts of L_economic L_determinism and L_historical L_necessity with the L_individualism of L_Sartre 's L_earlier L_work , that is the L_existentialist L_notion of the L_authentic L_self and the L_possibility of L_choosing one 's own L_freedom : how to M_relocate L_human L_practice within L_historical L_determinism , to M_reconcile the L_individual with the L_social , the L_idea of L_agency with that of L_necessity , or L_freedom with L_history ?"
cty-fragment03,465,"For L_Marxist or L_Hegelian L_thought , such an L_age-old L_contradiction ought to be L_resolvable through the L_operations of L_dialectical L_logic ."
cty-fragment03,466,"L_Citing L_Marx 's L_famous L_remark in The L_Eighteenth L_Brumaire , ‘ L_Men M_make their own L_History … but under L_circumstances … M_given and M_transmitted from the L_past ’ , L_Sartre L_suggested that this L_implied ‘ the L_permanent and L_dialectical L_unity of L_freedom and L_necessity , ( I , 35 ) ."
cty-fragment03,467,"L_Accordingly , he L_attempted to M_shift L_Marxism M_away from L_orthodox L_theories of an L_absolute L_determinism towards the L_primacy of a L_concept of ‘ L_History ’ which , while L_still a L_totality as it had been for Lukács , a L_process with a L_determinate L_meaning and M_end , could L_also M_include a L_concept of L_human L_agency and L_thus M_articulate the L_individual with the L_social , L_freedom with L_determinism ."
cty-fragment03,468,"L_Today , L_Sartre 's L_voluntarism is to some M_extent M_returning to L_favour as the L_result of a L_desire to M_retrieve the L_categories of L_agency and the M_subject , which M_goes M_together with the L_wish to M_get out of the L_apparently L_totalizing M_systems of L_Adorno , L_Althusser or L_Foucault ."
cty-fragment03,469,"L_Sartre 's M_stress on the M_role of the M_subject L_also M_finds L_approval because L_many of those no L_longer M_prepared to L_argue for a L_general L_theory of L_history as the M_progress of a L_single M_narrative of M_class-struggle , have L_begun to L_argue L_instead for a M_return of its L_correlative , the M_subject , L_almost as if it was the M_next L_best M_thing in the L_absence of L_history itself ."
cty-fragment03,470,"But it L_still M_leaves us with the L_crucial L_problem that L_Sartre had to L_solve , L_namely how to M_link L_human L_consciousness with the L_processes of L_history so that the L_former can be L_said to be the M_agent of the L_latter ."
cty-fragment03,471,How could this M_take L_place ?
cty-fragment03,472,As L_Sartre had M_put it in What is L_Literature ? :
cty-fragment03,473,‘ L_Never has homo faber L_better L_understood that he has M_made L_history and L_never has he M_felt so L_powerless before L_history ’ .
cty-fragment03,474,How can L_man M_make L_history if at the same L_time it is L_history which M_makes him ?
cty-fragment03,475,"L_Sartre M_considered that L_orthodox L_dialectical L_materialism M_takes the L_easy M_way out by L_merely M_eliminating the L_first in L_favour of the L_second , M_making L_man a M_passive M_product L_entirely L_determined by L_economic L_circumstances ."
cty-fragment03,476,"L_Unwilling to M_follow L_Merleau-Ponty by M_dropping the L_second in L_favour of the L_first , L_Sartre L_argued that it was L_possible for L_man to be both at once through the M_movement of L_praxis , that is L_intentional L_actions which M_produce M_material L_effects ."
cty-fragment03,477,"Its L_corollary , whereby L_praxis L_becomes L_determining L_history , he L_called the ‘ M_practico-inert ’ , by which he L_meant the L_material L_circumstances that have themselves been L_created by L_previous L_praxes and which L_form the L_conditions for L_new L_praxis ."
cty-fragment03,478,"The L_individual is L_thus both L_totalizer and L_totalized , M_deftly M_uniting L_freedom with L_necessity ."
cty-fragment03,479,"Though this M_neatly M_solves the L_problem of how L_man can M_make L_history while at the same L_time L_history M_makes him , it does not M_answer the M_larger L_question of how a L_multiplicity of the M_products of L_individual L_acts , ‘ L_totalizations ’ , can themselves be L_totalized into the L_overall L_totalization L_required by the L_logic of L_dialectical L_rationality — L_rather than being the L_arbitrary , M_blind and L_self-cancelling M_movements of , M_say , L_Hardy 's L_immanent will ."
cty-fragment03,480,"L_Sartre 's L_fundamental L_thesis , that ‘ L_History L_continually L_effects L_totalisations of L_totalisations ’ ( I , 15 ) , does not in itself M_answer what L_Ronald L_Aronson has L_rightly L_characterized as the L_question for L_Sartre : ‘ how do M_separate , M_antagonistic L_actions M_yield a L_history ; how do L_individual L_totalizations M_lead to L_Totalization ( and L_also M_progress , the M_direction of L_history , its L_truth and its L_meaning ) ? ’"
cty-fragment03,481,"For the M_whole L_basis of L_Sartre 's L_argument is that the L_dialectic of L_history is not a L_metaphysical M_law , ‘ some M_powerful L_unitary M_force M_revealing itself behind L_History like the will of L_God ’ , but the M_continuously M_produced L_effect of L_individual L_conflicts ; each L_action is in its M_turn L_subsumed as a M_part of the L_whole in an L_ever M_broader , L_developing L_totalization ( I , 37 ) ."
cty-fragment03,482,"What L_Sartre L_needs to L_demonstrate , L_therefore , is that if the M_law of the L_dialectic M_works from the L_individual M_level , L_overall it M_produces L_nothing L_less than the L_intelligibility or the L_meaning of L_History as such :"
cty-fragment03,483,"The L_dialectic is the M_law of L_totalization which L_creates L_several L_collectivities , L_several L_societies , and one L_history — L_realities , that is , which M_impose themselves on L_individuals ; but at the same L_time it must be M_woven out of L_millions of L_individual L_actions ."
cty-fragment03,484,We must M_show that it is L_possible for it to be both a L_resultant … and a L_totalizing M_force … how it can L_continually L_bring about the L_unity of L_dispersive L_profusion and L_integration .
cty-fragment03,485,"( I , 36 )"
cty-fragment03,486,But what M_produces the L_overall M_direction of L_History ?
cty-fragment03,487,How does it ‘ L_continually L_bring about the L_unity of L_dispersive L_profusion and L_integration ’ ?
cty-fragment03,488,"L_Sartre does not L_attempt to L_answer this L_question , M_shifting L_rather to the L_notion of a L_lack of L_self-consciousness ."
cty-fragment03,489,The L_dialectic is the M_law that L_remains M_hidden .
cty-fragment03,490,"At the L_moment , ‘ L_history is M_made without being L_known ( l'histoire se L_fait L_sans se connâitre ) ’ — L_history L_constitutes , we might L_say L_today , a M_political M_unconscious ."
cty-fragment03,491,"‘ L_Marxism ’ , on the other M_hand , L_Sartre L_claims , ‘ is L_History itself L_becoming M_conscious of itself ’ ( I , 40 ) : as for Lukács , it is by L_becoming M_conscious of itself as the M_subject of L_history that the L_working L_class will M_understand L_history 's L_meaning — and so M_recognize itself as the L_meaning of L_history ."
cty-fragment03,492,"While he M_suggests in L_apocalyptic M_tones in The L_Problem of L_Method that this L_process of L_self-consciousness is at L_last L_beginning to M_take L_place , and that L_civil , L_foreign and L_colonial L_wars are L_becoming L_apparent as L_different M_forms of a L_single L_class M_struggle , L_Sartre L_also M_admits that the M_divorce between L_theory and L_praxis which L_ensued under L_Stalinism has L_generally L_prevented any M_clear L_self-consciousness among the M_masses ."
cty-fragment03,493,"The ‘ M_detour , of L_Stalinism is L_thus L_formalized as L_Marxism 's own M_descent into its M_unconscious , L_resulting in a M_dream-work of L_heterogeneous L_histories that have M_eluded L_systematization and L_subsumption into the L_single L_meaning of L_Marxism 's own M_reading of L_history ."
cty-fragment03,494,"It is L_therefore , L_Sartre L_argues , our L_historical L_task to M_make it L_known , L_promoting not just the L_historical L_process as such , but L_also the L_general M_recognition whereby the L_plurality of the L_meanings of L_individual L_histories can be M_seen to M_combine to M_make one L_history , with one L_meaning — the ‘ L_Truth of L_humanity ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
cty-fragment03,495,"L_Sartre 's M_account L_thus M_sets up the M_articulation of L_history , L_univocal L_meaning , and L_totality as the L_indissoluble L_set of M_elements L_required for the L_validation of L_Marxism , L_necessary in L_order to M_save it from its M_detour from itself ."
cty-fragment03,496,"The L_problem , L_however , M_remains how such L_universals are M_produced from the L_multiplicity of M_initiating L_individual L_praxes ."
cty-fragment03,497,"If L_History is a L_history of L_conflict , how could it be both one and M_internally L_diversified without the M_inner M_moving L_principle of the L_dialectic ?"
cty-fragment03,498,"How can L_History be a L_unity if it is L_also L_conflictual , if each L_action is M_aimed at M_destroying the other and L_results in a M_double M_negation in which the L_original M_aims of each L_action have been M_destroyed by the other ?"
cty-fragment03,499,"If each L_action L_negates the M_aim of the other , where is the ‘ L_unity ’ L_totalized in the L_conflict ?"
cty-fragment03,500,How does L_History L_constantly L_totalize itself ?
cty-fragment03,501,"( I , 817 — 18 ) L_Sartre M_arrives at what he L_calls ‘ the L_real L_problem of L_History ’ , that is how there can be L_totalization without a L_totalizer , only at the very M_end of L_Volume I. It is not until the M_next L_volume , L_however , that he L_intends to M_show how L_individual L_actions , L_separate L_multiplicities , M_make up ‘ one L_human L_history , with one L_truth and one L_intelligibility ’ ( I , 69 ) ."
cty-fragment03,502,"Throughout , L_Sartre has L_nevertheless M_taken it ‘ for L_granted that such a L_totalisation is L_constantly L_developing both as L_History and as L_historical L_Truth ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
cty-fragment03,503,"His L_History , L_therefore , is L_always in L_process : but its L_teleology of a L_final L_totalization L_always has to be M_assumed ."
cty-fragment03,504,He L_thus L_asserts the L_Truth of L_History while L_constantly M_projecting M_forwards and L_deferring its L_proof .
cty-fragment03,505,But when the L_proof M_comes it L_also M_turns out to M_rest on the L_assumption that it is L_already M_true .
cty-fragment03,506,III THE L_SECOND L_CRITIQUE :
cty-fragment03,507,‘ We are L_trying to L_establish the L_Truth of History'
cty-fragment03,508,L_Sartre M_produces a M_persuasive M_formulation of the M_relation of the L_individual to the L_determining L_historical L_circumstance through his L_concepts of L_praxis and the M_practico-inert ; it is L_also L_obvious to him how the M_larger L_question of L_History ought to be L_solved .
cty-fragment03,509,"He L_asserts it L_often L_enough : ‘ L_History L_continually L_effects L_totalisations of L_totalisations , ( I , 15 ) ."
cty-fragment03,510,"But in L_Volume I of the L_Critique , as we have M_seen , he L_continually L_defers the M_demonstration of his L_proof ."
cty-fragment03,511,"For the ‘ L_dogmatic L_dialectic ’ , as he L_describes L_dialectical L_materialism , the M_whole L_question M_naturally L_poses no L_problem , for each L_person or L_group L_simply L_constitutes a L_partial L_moment of an L_already M_operative M_movement of L_totalization that M_produces them and then M_goes beyond them ."
cty-fragment03,512,"But L_Sartre 's M_dispensing with all L_historicist M_schemas L_creates the L_problem of how , between two L_autonomous and L_contradictory L_totalizations , there could be ‘ one L_dialectical L_intelligibility of the L_ongoing L_process ’ ( II , 13 ) ."
cty-fragment03,513,"He L_attempts to L_solve this through M_matching his M_account of L_contradiction with a L_new L_concept M_derived from the L_conjunction of L_work and L_labour : ‘ L_anti-labour ’ ( L_anti-travail ) , a L_category of M_negation ."
cty-fragment03,514,"The M_products of a L_conflict , as L_well as its M_residues , may L_seem L_incomprehensible L_insofar as they L_differ from the L_original L_intentions of any of the M_combatants ."
cty-fragment03,515,L_Nevertheless they L_constitute the L_basis and L_conditions for further L_actions and L_history .
cty-fragment03,516,L_Dialectical L_reason M_encounters such M_products as L_undecidables :
cty-fragment03,517,aporias — because they L_seem to be at once the L_results of a L_communal L_enterprise while at the same L_time M_bearing M_witness to the L_fact that this L_enterprise L_never L_existed except as the L_inhuman L_reverse M_side of two L_opposed L_actions in which each M_aims to M_destroy the other .
cty-fragment03,518,"In the L_dialectical M_perspective , we M_encounter these M_objects as L_productions which are L_human and L_provided with a L_future … L_thus they L_seem by themselves to be L_totalizations in L_process ."
cty-fragment03,519,"( II , 20 )"
cty-fragment03,520,"This M_means that L_first , they M_lead to L_results , and L_second , that the M_internal M_structure of L_social M_objects M_contains ‘ the L_double M_negation of themselves and of each L_constituent M_part by the other ’ ( II , 22 ) ."
cty-fragment03,521,"There is , L_therefore , before any L_understanding of L_historic M_agents and M_movements , a L_certain L_aporia in all L_social M_ensembles : from M_afar they may M_appear M_whole , but M_close to , they can be M_seen as M_riddled with M_holes ."
cty-fragment03,522,This L_increasingly M_comes to L_resemble L_nothing so L_much as L_Sartre 's own M_account of L_History .
cty-fragment03,523,"In the M_context of the L_negativity of this M_formulation , L_Sartre is L_obliged to L_pose once again the L_problem of whether there can be a L_totalization , without any L_independent L_totalizer or L_totalizing M_force such as the L_dialectic , or whether the M_structure of M_negation that he has L_described M_means that , as for L_Adorno or L_Bakhtin , L_history does not L_develop L_positively but , L_rather , L_negatively , and is L_therefore L_instead L_detotalizing :"
cty-fragment03,524,"L_Marxism is L_rigorously M_true if L_History is L_totalization ; it is not so any more if L_human L_history M_decomposes into a L_plurality of L_particular L_histories , or if , in any L_case , within the M_relationship of L_immanence that L_characterizes M_struggle , the M_negation of each M_adversary by the other is on L_principle L_detotalizing ."
cty-fragment03,525,"L_Certainly , we have neither the M_design nor the L_actual L_possibility of M_showing here the M_full L_truth of L_dialectical L_materialism …"
cty-fragment03,526,"Our M_goal is L_solely to L_establish whether , in a L_practical M_ensemble M_torn M_apart by L_antagonism ( whether there are L_multiple L_conflicts or whether they are M_reduced to one ) the M_breaks themselves are L_totalizing and M_carried M_along by the L_totalizing M_movement of the M_ensemble ."
cty-fragment03,527,"( II , 25 )"
cty-fragment03,528,"At this M_point L_Sartre M_confronts the L_possibility that the M_whole L_project of the L_Critique , L_stated so L_confidently on its very L_first L_page — ‘ it must be L_proved that a M_negation of a M_negation can be an M_affirmation ’ ( I , 15 ) — may M_break down ."
cty-fragment03,529,L_perhaps the L_Truth of L_History can not be L_proved ; its M_direction can not be M_discerned .
cty-fragment03,530,"L_Sartre 's M_reaction to the M_threat that the M_negation of a M_negation may M_produce a L_detotalizing L_effect is to M_introduce a L_new L_category , a L_unifying M_force of a ‘ L_singularization ’ which M_incarnates the L_universal : ‘ If L_totalization L_really is an L_ongoing L_process ’ , he L_writes , ‘ then it M_operates L_everywhere ."
cty-fragment03,531,"That L_means both that there is a L_dialectical L_meaning of the L_practical M_ensemble … and that each L_singular L_event L_totalizes in itself the L_practical M_ensemble in the L_infinite M_richness of its L_singularity ’ ( II , 26 ) ."
cty-fragment03,532,"Unlike Lukács ' L_insignificant L_event from which the L_universal is L_precariously M_drawn out through the L_narrative , L_Sartre 's L_singularity M_works L_synecdochally in a L_conventional L_antinomy with the L_universal , the M_relation between the two M_structured L_according to the M_familiar L_nineteenth-century M_model of M_organic M_growth or L_process in which each L_singular L_event M_makes up the L_whole while , as he M_puts it , ‘ the L_whole is L_entirely L_present in the M_part as its M_present L_meaning and as its L_destiny ’ ."
cty-fragment03,533,"L_Sartre 's ‘ L_singular L_universal ’ , L_therefore , M_begs the L_question , for it is L_predicated on the L_assumption that , if there is not a L_totality as such , then there L_already is an L_overall L_totalization : ‘ If L_totalization L_really is an L_ongoing L_process … ’ ."
cty-fragment03,534,"That L_developing L_process is itself L_totalized through L_Sartre 's M_assertion that each L_totalization is the L_totalization of all M_struggles , as it must be if the L_singular is to M_incarnate the L_universal ."
cty-fragment03,535,The L_concept of the L_singular L_universal L_thus L_facilitates a L_circularity in the L_argument whereby L_Sartre can M_avoid the L_question which he L_began by L_posing .
cty-fragment03,536,So the L_singular L_universal M_presumes the L_totalization he ca n't ( L_yet ) L_prove .
cty-fragment03,537,"This M_strategy M_marks a M_structure of L_repetition in L_Sartre 's L_text : each L_time he L_poses the L_question of how there can be L_totalization of L_History without a L_totalizer , he M_retreats to a more L_limited L_example whose L_unity is L_already L_evident , but which in the M_end only M_brings him M_back to the L_original L_question again ."
cty-fragment03,538,"In this L_case L_Sartre M_demonstrates how the L_singular L_universal M_works , by M_appealing to the M_concrete L_example of a L_boxing L_match — a L_random L_exemplification that just L_happens to M_reproduce the L_single M_adversaries of the master/slave L_dialectic ."
cty-fragment03,539,"Its L_totalization M_takes L_place through its M_incarnation , as M_part of the L_totality of L_boxing , in the L_overall M_framework within which each L_individual L_fight L_occurs ."
cty-fragment03,540,"Each L_boxing L_match , L_Sartre L_claims , must be both a L_unique L_event and L_also in some M_sense the M_incarnation of all L_boxing , whose M_rules and L_conventions it M_follows , and whose L_past and L_future L_history it M_sets itself against ."
cty-fragment03,541,"But it is L_also L_apparent that that L_totality is not L_completely L_known , nor is its L_future M_shape L_even L_presumed ."
cty-fragment03,542,"By L_totalization , L_therefore , L_Sartre does not here L_mean L_anything like a L_predetermined M_end or L_final M_closure of a L_totality but L_rather a L_process of M_mediation among the M_parts , where each is L_determined by the other ."
cty-fragment03,543,"No L_one can L_predict the L_future of L_boxing , either at the M_level of L_particular M_victories or M_defeats , in L_effect a M_structure of L_repetition , nor at the more L_general M_level of L_possible L_modifications or L_developments of the L_sport ."
cty-fragment03,544,"L_Yet each L_individual L_bout M_articulates itself within the M_framework of the L_history of L_boxing , L_known and L_unknown ."
cty-fragment03,545,This M_allows L_Sartre to M_include L_chance and L_contingency in his L_scheme .
cty-fragment03,546,"Since it can not be L_known as a L_concept that will M_realize itself in the L_future , L_Sartre L_argues L_instead that the L_totality only M_produces itself in the L_moment : ‘ The M_incarnation as such is at once L_unrealizable except as L_totalization of L_everything and L_irreducible to a M_pure L_abstract L_unity of that which it L_totalizes ’ ( II , 58 ) ."
cty-fragment03,547,"The L_universal , the L_totality , can only be L_known through the L_singular ."
cty-fragment03,548,But its L_future M_direction L_remains L_unknown and L_indeterminate .
cty-fragment03,549,"At the same L_time L_Sartre M_makes a M_larger , though L_less L_persuasive L_claim that the L_boxing-match L_also M_works L_synecdochally and L_re-exteriorizes a more L_fundamental L_violence , L_namely the L_interiorized L_condition of L_scarcity that he M_considers to be the L_basis of L_conflict in L_general ."
cty-fragment03,550,"The L_boxing L_match ‘ is the L_public M_incarnation of all L_conflict ’ ( II , 32 ) , L_totalizing in its own M_struggle the L_whole of ‘ L_contemporary L_irreducibilities and M_fissures ’ ( II , 26 ) :"
cty-fragment03,551,"L_thus one can and must L_say … that each L_fight is the L_singularisation of all the L_circumstances of the L_social L_whole in M_movement and that by this L_singularisation , it M_incarnates the M_enveloping L_totalization which the L_historical L_process is ."
cty-fragment03,552,"( II , 58 )"
cty-fragment03,553,"But then he L_adds , ‘ I have L_said and I L_repeat that we have not L_yet L_proved that this M_enveloping L_totalization L_exists ’ ."
cty-fragment03,554,"So , although it is L_possible to M_conceive of any L_event as an M_incarnation of the L_totality , L_insofar as it must itself M_make up a M_part of that L_totality in its L_determination , unlike the L_case of the L_boxing L_match , where we can M_define the L_overall L_entity ‘ L_boxing ’ , it L_still L_remains L_unproven that an L_overall L_entity , ‘ L_History ’ , can be L_said to L_exist at all ."
cty-fragment03,555,"For all his L_use of the M_model of the L_boxing L_match , L_Sartre has L_really M_got no further with the L_fundamental L_question of how there can be L_totalization without a L_totalizer ."
cty-fragment03,556,"It is L_simple L_enough for him to M_show that a L_boxing L_match M_takes L_place within a L_general L_totality of ‘ L_boxing ’ , which is itself only L_ever L_present in any L_individual M_incarnation , for as a L_game each L_match is both an L_individual L_bout and L_something M_conducted L_according to L_general M_rules and a L_specific L_social L_tradition ."
cty-fragment03,557,"But what about those L_conflicts that do not M_take L_place within such a L_constituted L_social M_system , such as L_conflictual L_bourgeois L_societies which can not be L_said to be L_unified , except , as L_Sartre M_suggests L_dismissively , by M_appeal to a M_lost M_paradise before the L_class M_struggle ?"
cty-fragment03,558,"Such L_societies M_make the L_conflicts of L_history L_irreducible to L_Sartre 's L_logic unless , like the L_boxing L_match , they can be M_shown to M_take M_part in a M_larger L_totalizable L_category ."
cty-fragment03,559,"L_However , when he L_poses the L_question of whether his L_method could M_work as L_well for the L_class M_struggle as for the L_boxing L_match , L_Sartre M_admits that he M_finds it L_impossible to L_answer and M_returns L_instead to the L_much L_easier L_case of L_sub-groups ."
cty-fragment03,560,Once again he M_backtracks and M_assumes a M_larger L_unity in which L_conflict M_takes L_place .
cty-fragment03,561,"The L_major L_question L_thus L_always L_remains L_unanswered in the L_Critique : every L_time that L_Sartre M_announces that he is about to M_proceed with the L_fundamental L_problem of how L_History can be a L_totalization without a L_totalizer , he M_turns M_back to a L_previous , more L_easily L_intelligible M_stage on the M_way ."
cty-fragment03,562,"His L_difficulty is M_accompanied by a no L_doubt M_symptomatic L_increasing L_distrust of L_universals so that , in L_championing L_specificities against them , he L_seems to L_give up the L_attempt to L_validate the L_universals — L_History as L_Totalization — that L_originally M_formed the M_object of his L_project ."
cty-fragment03,563,"At this M_point a further L_contradiction in L_Sartre 's M_whole L_enterprise L_begins to M_open up : for L_someone so M_deeply L_distrustful of L_universals it L_seems L_curious that he has L_involved himself so L_emphatically with the L_notions of L_totality , L_History , and the L_dialectic ."
cty-fragment03,564,"As L_Sartre L_insists more and more upon the M_virtues of L_specificity ( II , 200 — 05 ) , such is his L_distaste for L_Marxist or any other L_universalizing L_categories that he L_refuses L_even to L_countenance them , L_attempting to M_replace L_concepts with L_specificities , L_universals with L_singulars ."
cty-fragment03,565,"His L_scepticism M_goes to the M_extent of L_even L_denying the L_existence of ‘ L_society ’ or ‘ the L_nation ’ as such ( II , 24 , 61 ) — the very L_totalities which his own L_general L_argument for L_totalization L_requires ."
cty-fragment03,566,"Here L_certain L_similarities with L_later ‘ L_post-Marxist ’ L_theorists such as L_Foucault or L_Lyotard , L_begin to L_become L_apparent ."
cty-fragment03,567,But if L_Sartre L_anticipates such L_later L_thinkers we should not M_assume too M_quickly that they have L_simply M_taken his L_insights further .
cty-fragment03,568,"For L_Sartre 's L_singular L_universal could L_never be L_expected to L_solve the M_formal L_theoretical L_problem of how L_individual L_existential L_existence can be L_related to L_History L_insofar as it L_simply L_renames , in one L_oxymoronic L_category , the L_original L_antithetical L_terms ."
cty-fragment03,569,"Without an L_adequate L_theory of their M_articulation , they L_simply L_begin to M_separate again ."

ecv-fragment05,1037,The L_Philosopher 's L_Child
ecv-fragment05,1038,L_Judith L_Hughes
ecv-fragment05,1039,SOME OF OUR L_CHILDREN ARE MISSING
ecv-fragment05,1040,L_Children have M_served L_philosophy very L_well .
ecv-fragment05,1041,That is the L_first M_thing which L_anyone M_surveying the L_literature would L_notice .
ecv-fragment05,1042,"Along with a L_selection from a L_list L_including L_women , L_animals , L_madmen , L_foreigners , L_slaves , L_patients and L_imbeciles , L_children have M_served in that M_great L_class of beings , the ‘ L_not-men ’ , in M_contrast with which L_male L_philosophers have M_defined and M_valued themselves ."
ecv-fragment05,1043,"Unlike the L_others who M_appear and M_disappear as M_fashion and M_progress M_dictate , L_children M_occupy a L_permanent M_place in the L_list L_partly because of their L_continuing M_presence as a L_potential M_sub-class , L_partly because they have L_never L_protested and L_mainly because it is L_assumed that in L_favourable L_circumstances they will L_become L_men and L_therefore L_require L_attention ."
ecv-fragment05,1044,They have L_received it in the M_shape of L_detailed L_educational L_theory L_carefully L_worked out to M_see them through the L_maturation L_process from L_infancy to L_adulthood .
ecv-fragment05,1045,L_Generations of L_philosophers have L_documented this L_process .
ecv-fragment05,1046,L_Perhaps the L_best L_known L_version is L_Shakespeare 's seven L_ages of L_man which is a L_poetic L_statement of what had L_already been L_received L_wisdom for L_centuries and was to L_remain so for L_centuries to M_come .
ecv-fragment05,1047,"L_Education was to M_guide the L_infant through the L_transition to L_manhood L_including such M_stages as L_childhood , L_boyhood and L_youth ."
ecv-fragment05,1048,That is the L_second M_thing to L_notice ; the L_philosopher 's L_children are L_boys .
ecv-fragment05,1049,"The L_fact that at L_least L_half of the L_world 's L_children would not L_actually M_go through this L_process beyond the L_first two M_stages is L_conveniently L_forgotten or L_ignored and , no L_doubt , the L_reasons for this were L_largely L_social ."
ecv-fragment05,1050,"But the L_neglect of L_girl L_children through the L_centuries of L_theorising is more than a L_social L_injustice , though L_many might L_think this L_real and L_bad L_enough ."
ecv-fragment05,1051,L_Education has an M_end .
ecv-fragment05,1052,"Although it is L_fashionable to L_talk about its M_value ‘ for its own L_sake ’ , what M_prompts the L_theorising is the M_strong and L_well-founded L_belief that the L_experiences of L_childhood L_affect the L_kind of L_adult which the L_child M_turns out to be ."
ecv-fragment05,1053,"Where the M_end is L_person- L_rather than M_role-oriented — that is , where the M_end is the L_development of the L_human L_mind and L_spirit L_rather than the M_production of , L_say , L_information L_technologists — then L_education is M_valued in L_relation to some M_conception of L_worthwhile L_human L_existence which it is L_meant to M_serve ."
ecv-fragment05,1054,"Such an L_ideal does not M_stand M_isolated from the L_practices which M_strive towards it but M_interacts with those L_practices , M_helps to M_construct them , and is in M_turn M_constructed by them ."
ecv-fragment05,1055,The M_great L_philosophers have L_always M_produced such a L_person-oriented M_account at L_least for those whose L_education was L_thought to L_matter .
ecv-fragment05,1056,"L_Education has been M_directed at the M_production of the L_rational , the M_free , the L_independent of L_mind , the L_dignified , in L_short , the M_autonomous L_human being ."
ecv-fragment05,1057,"L_Yet because the L_philosopher 's L_adult has L_traditionally been L_male , his L_children L_boy L_children , and his L_educational L_programmes M_designed to L_facilitate the L_transition between them , the L_ideal of the L_fully L_human L_person has been L_masculinised to the M_point where L_otherwise L_thoughtful and L_sometimes L_good and L_wise L_men have L_unashamedly M_admitted that this M_defining L_ideal is not L_applicable to half the L_species ."
ecv-fragment05,1058,"L_Rationality L_turns into M_narrow L_intellectualism , M_freedom into L_licence , L_independence into L_isolationism , L_dignity into L_selfish L_pride ; the M_autonomous L_human being M_turns out to be no more than a L_social M_atom after all ."
ecv-fragment05,1059,"The L_degeneration M_occurs , not because L_men are M_congenitally or L_even L_incorrigibly M_narrow , L_libertine , M_isolated or L_selfish , but because in M_defining themselves as M_autonomous beings in L_opposition to other L_human beings they have had to L_seek what M_separates them as a M_group from L_others ."
ecv-fragment05,1060,It is a M_curiously L_paradoxical M_foundation uponupon which to M_build a L_theory of M_autonomy .
ecv-fragment05,1061,L_Moral M_autonomy is M_concerned with L_individuals not with M_groups ; a M_conception of M_autonomy which L_depends upon M_group L_membership M_displays its own L_contradiction .
ecv-fragment05,1062,This L_paper is L_partly about the L_rejection of L_certain M_accounts of M_autonomy though not with the L_rejection of the L_ideal of M_autonomy itself .
ecv-fragment05,1063,It is L_also about L_children .
ecv-fragment05,1064,L_WOMEN L_PHILOSOPHERS AND L_GIRL L_CHILDREN
ecv-fragment05,1065,Why should L_women in L_general and L_women L_philosophers in L_particular be L_specially L_interested in the M_nature and L_status of L_children ?
ecv-fragment05,1066,"There are , of L_course , the L_familiar and L_obvious L_reasons M_connected with L_women 's L_traditional M_role in L_child-rearing but there are L_less L_obvious L_reasons too ."
ecv-fragment05,1067,When L_philosophers M_dismiss L_women as ‘ L_not-men ’ they L_frequently do more than L_simply L_lump them M_together with L_children or L_lunatics .
ecv-fragment05,1068,L_Explicitly or L_implicitly the L_suggestion is that L_women are L_children or L_lunatics or whichever other M_company they M_keep .
ecv-fragment05,1069,It would be L_well to L_know just what this M_entails .
ecv-fragment05,1070,L_Schopenhauer M_said that L_women L_remain L_big L_children all their L_lives ; it would be L_interesting to L_know what he L_thought L_children were L_like .
ecv-fragment05,1071,"A L_common L_result of this is that when the L_philosophers L_deny M_autonomy to L_women , they do so for the same L_sorts of L_reason that they L_deny it to L_children and L_cite L_lack of L_rationality , L_capriciousness and L_vulnerability among their L_characteristics ."
ecv-fragment05,1072,We can do more than to L_reject such L_descriptions of ourselves ; we can L_ask further L_questions : are L_children like this ? is this why L_children are not M_autonomous ?
ecv-fragment05,1073,"Again , L_women L_well L_know what it is like to be L_treated as L_children and they M_find it M_offensive ."
ecv-fragment05,1074,It would L_therefore be L_reasonable to M_consider whether L_children M_find it M_offensive to be L_treated like L_children .
ecv-fragment05,1075,Is being L_treated as a L_child an L_intrinsically L_humiliating and L_self-denying L_experience ?
ecv-fragment05,1076,What is it to be L_treated as a L_child ?
ecv-fragment05,1077,L_Women L_philosophers are in a L_special M_position to M_consider such L_questions for in the M_image of the L_philosopher 's L_child they M_see themselves .
ecv-fragment05,1078,"It is no M_accident that the M_liberation of L_women , such as it is , should M_form M_part of a M_wider M_movement of M_liberation in L_general ; M_liberation for one M_part of the ‘ L_not-men ’ is M_bound to have a L_knock-on L_effect when your M_fellow M_groups are L_sometimes L_quite L_literally L_identified with you ."
ecv-fragment05,1079,"The L_assumption that all M_groups in the ‘ L_not-men ’ L_class are L_identical with each other is so M_firmly L_rooted that , as we shall M_see in the L_fourth M_section , it is L_readily L_assumed L_even by L_modern L_libertarian L_thinkers that M_showing that , for L_example , some M_ground for M_distinguishing between L_men and L_women is M_false or L_irrelevant , M_immediately M_commits us to the M_view that the same M_ground is L_irrelevant in M_distinguishing L_men from L_children ."
ecv-fragment05,1080,‘ That 's what they L_used to M_say about L_women ’ is not a L_proof that M_saying it about a L_child is M_false .
ecv-fragment05,1081,But it should M_make us very L_suspicious .
ecv-fragment05,1082,"That when L_women are M_given the L_vote it M_follows that L_children should be M_given it too is no L_argument at all , but a L_version of it M_occurs in L_modern L_debates over the L_justice or L_injustice of L_Mill 's L_famous L_disclaimer in his L_essay On L_Liberty ."
ecv-fragment05,1083,"Having L_denied that we may L_ever L_legitimately L_interfere with the M_liberty of another except on the M_grounds of L_self-protection , L_Mill ( 1910 ) M_asserts :"
ecv-fragment05,1084,this L_principle is L_meant to M_apply only to L_human beings in the L_maturity of their L_faculties .
ecv-fragment05,1085,We are not M_speaking of L_children or of L_young L_persons below the L_age which the L_law may M_fix as that of L_manhood or L_womanhood .
ecv-fragment05,1086,Those who are L_still in a L_state to L_require being M_taken L_care of by L_others must be L_protected against their own L_actions as L_well as against L_external M_injury .
ecv-fragment05,1087,( p.73 )
ecv-fragment05,1088,"This M_view , as we shall M_see , has been M_attacked on the M_grounds that it M_rests on the M_false L_assumption that the L_distinction between L_adults and L_children is L_identical with the L_distinction between L_rational and L_non-rational beings ."
ecv-fragment05,1089,The M_attacks are M_based on L_empirical M_observation ; most L_women and L_older L_children are L_actually L_quite as L_rational as most L_men while some L_men are L_actually L_less L_rational .
ecv-fragment05,1090,If we L_agree that in that L_case L_women should be M_embraced by the M_liberty L_principle then so should L_children .
ecv-fragment05,1091,I shall L_suggest that this does not M_follow because L_rationality is not in L_fact the M_grounds for the L_distinction in the L_first M_place .
ecv-fragment05,1092,"L_Partly to L_redress the M_balance and L_partly because M_talking about ‘ L_children ’ M_covers such a M_wide M_range of L_potential M_images , I shall L_try to M_keep before my L_mind an L_ordinary 10-year-old of our L_society ."
ecv-fragment05,1093,She is the L_child of this L_paper unless I M_indicate L_otherwise .
ecv-fragment05,1094,"Throughout we should L_ask ourselves , does this ( whatever is being M_said ) M_apply to her ?"
ecv-fragment05,1095,"L_First of all , L_let us L_remind ourselves of the L_traditional M_picture of L_children M_drawn for us by some M_great L_philosophers of the L_past ."
ecv-fragment05,1096,One M_thing they are all L_quite L_sure about is that L_children are not like L_adults ; in L_particular they L_agree that L_children L_lack some M_capacity for L_rational L_thought which L_adults have .
ecv-fragment05,1097,NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18 … .
ecv-fragment05,1098,"the L_slave has L_absolutely no L_deliberative L_faculty ; the L_woman has but its M_authority is L_imperfect ; so has the L_child , but in this L_case it is M_immature ."
ecv-fragment05,1099,"( L_Aristotle , 1959,1260A )"
ecv-fragment05,1100,"L_Children … are not M_endued with L_Reason at all , till they have L_attained the L_use of L_speech but are M_called L_Reasonable L_Creatures for the L_possibility L_apparent of having the L_use of L_Reason in L_time to M_come ."
ecv-fragment05,1101,"( L_Hobbes , 1914 , p. 21 )"
ecv-fragment05,1102,L_Children … L_love to be L_treated as L_Rational L_Creatures L_sooner than is L_imagined … by which …
ecv-fragment05,1103,"I L_mean , that you should M_make them L_sensible by the Mildness of your M_carriage , and the L_composure L_even in your L_correction of them , that what you do is L_reasonable in you and L_useful and L_necessary for them ."
ecv-fragment05,1104,"( L_Locke , 1968 , p. 181 )"
ecv-fragment05,1105,"In M_training for L_youth , the L_child must be M_given L_reasons ; in the M_training of the L_infant for L_childhood this can not be done ."
ecv-fragment05,1106,"L_Young L_children ought L_merely to have M_things M_shown to them as they are , or they L_get L_puzzled and L_ask L_question after L_question ."
ecv-fragment05,1107,But as we M_approach the L_age of L_youth L_reason M_appears .
ecv-fragment05,1108,At what L_age ought the L_education for L_youth to M_begin ?
ecv-fragment05,1109,"M_Roughly at the L_age of ten L_years , when by M_nature the L_child M_enters the M_stage of L_youth and L_begins to M_reflect …"
ecv-fragment05,1110,"The L_youth … is L_capable of having L_principles ; his L_religious and L_moral L_ideas can be M_cultivated , and he is L_able to L_attend to his own M_refinement ."
ecv-fragment05,1111,"( L_Kant , 1930 , pp. 250–1 )"
ecv-fragment05,1112,"If a L_society M_lets any L_considerable L_number of its M_members L_grow up L_mere L_children , L_incapable of being L_acted on by L_rational M_consideration of M_distant L_motives , L_society has itself to M_blame for the L_consequences ."
ecv-fragment05,1113,"( L_Mill , 1910 , p. 139 )"
ecv-fragment05,1114,What are the L_philosophers ' L_children like ?
ecv-fragment05,1115,"They have an ‘ M_immature ’ L_deliberative L_faculty ( L_Aristotle ) , are not ‘ M_endued with L_Reason ’ ( L_Hobbes ) , until M_roughly the L_age of 10 ( L_Kant ) and are ‘ L_incapable of being M_acted upon by L_rational L_consideration of M_distant L_motives ’ ( L_Mill ) ."
ecv-fragment05,1116,But they are not L_completely M_lost M_causes .
ecv-fragment05,1117,The M_immature L_deliberative L_faculty will M_mature ; L_children have the ‘ L_possibility L_apparent ’ of L_turning into L_rational beings ( L_Hobbes ) ; they L_love to be L_reated as though they were L_rational though they are not so L_yet ( L_Locke ) ; you can M_give the L_prerational L_child L_reasons for L_acting in L_certain M_ways and he will L_turn into the L_youth who is L_capable of having L_principles ( L_Kant ) .
ecv-fragment05,1118,Until the L_time when these M_things L_happen then L_Mill 's L_disclaimer M_comes into L_operation .
ecv-fragment05,1119,L_Children must be M_taken L_care of by L_others and L_protected from L_external M_injury and against their own L_actions .
ecv-fragment05,1120,"The L_traditional M_view is M_encapsulated in the L_claim that L_children are not M_autonomous ; that is , on a L_standard L_interpretation , they L_lack the M_capacity to L_act L_rationally in M_pursuit of their own L_self-chosen M_goals ."
ecv-fragment05,1121,It is then a L_matter of L_preference whether you M_say that they can not L_choose the M_goals or that they can not M_form L_strategies to L_achieve them or both .
ecv-fragment05,1122,"In either L_case , the L_political L_implication is that L_denying L_rights to L_children is L_entirely M_justified , and there the L_matter M_rests ."
ecv-fragment05,1123,"In all this , there are L_perhaps a L_couple of M_things which M_look L_plausible when we L_compare the L_philosopher 's L_child with our L_mental M_picture ; L_Aristotle 's M_observation that L_children are M_immature and L_Mill 's L_suggestion that they might L_need L_protection ."
ecv-fragment05,1124,"Beyond that , the L_similarities L_seem M_remote ."
ecv-fragment05,1125,There is L_obviously L_something L_wrong with a L_portrayal of L_children as L_totally L_lacking in L_reason until they L_leap out of L_bed on their L_tenth L_birthday L_announcing that they are now L_able to L_act on L_principle .
ecv-fragment05,1126,"L_Apart from being L_false , such an M_account M_leaves no M_room in our L_thinking about L_children for M_things like L_teaching and L_learning , or L_development in L_understanding and L_character and all those other L_concepts which M_refer to L_processes and not to L_states ."
ecv-fragment05,1127,"The M_tension between these L_theoretical M_views of L_children as L_non-rational , M_non-autonomous beings and the L_practical L_knowledge of L_real L_children is L_evident in those L_quotations from L_Hobbes and L_Locke and L_Kant and L_Mill ."
ecv-fragment05,1128,"L_Children , L_according to L_Hobbes , have the ‘ L_possibility L_apparent ’ of L_becoming L_reasonable ."
ecv-fragment05,1129,In what does the L_possibility L_consist ?
ecv-fragment05,1130,L_Hobbes is not L_using an L_inductive L_argument here ; the ‘ L_possibility L_apparent ’ is not an L_inductive L_argument from M_observations about M_past L_children but is L_meant to M_refer to some L_discernible M_feature of M_present L_ones .
ecv-fragment05,1131,But what ?
ecv-fragment05,1132,"L_Hobbes does not M_tell us , but whatever it is it had L_better be L_something which a L_monkey does not have ."
ecv-fragment05,1133,It is not L_language since L_Hobbes is here M_talking about the L_prelinguistic L_child .
ecv-fragment05,1134,L_Perhaps it L_consists in the L_ability to M_respond L_intelligently to the L_language of L_others .
ecv-fragment05,1135,"But then , either L_Hobbes has L_failed to M_distinguish the L_child from at L_least the M_higher and L_domesticated L_animals or the M_force of ‘ L_intelligently ’ must be L_explained in such a M_way as to M_exclude L_animals ."
ecv-fragment05,1136,"In any L_case , if such a L_qualification is M_called for it is M_hard to M_see how a L_creature with no L_rationality at all could M_possess it ."
ecv-fragment05,1137,L_Locke 's L_remarks are just as L_puzzling .
ecv-fragment05,1138,L_Children are L_definitely not L_rational but L_love to be L_treated as if they were .
ecv-fragment05,1139,How is this L_possible ?
ecv-fragment05,1140,L_Apparently they L_like having M_things L_explained to them without L_understanding either the L_explanation or L_even what an L_explanation is .
ecv-fragment05,1141,L_Perhaps he just L_means that they L_like the L_sound of my L_voice ?
ecv-fragment05,1142,"L_Well , L_maybe they do , but L_making any M_old L_noises is L_clearly not L_sufficient to M_enter the L_rationality M_stakes ; I must at L_least M_say L_something ."
ecv-fragment05,1143,Is it just that I L_talk to them that they L_love ?
ecv-fragment05,1144,"L_Maybe , but I can L_also , if I L_like , L_talk to my L_car , but L_yelling at it in the L_approved L_Basil L_Fawlty L_manner is L_hardly L_treating it as L_rational ."

ecv-fragment05,1146,L_Mill 's L_minors are a L_little more L_complicated .
ecv-fragment05,1147,M_Part of the L_time he M_sees them in the L_familiar M_way as L_creatures who L_lack L_rationality to at L_least some M_degree .
ecv-fragment05,1148,But in the L_disclaimer his L_children L_need above all to be L_protected from the L_ghastly L_consequences of their own L_actions .
ecv-fragment05,1149,"Their L_problem L_seems to be not one of the L_inability to M_choose M_goals or to M_form L_strategies for L_achieving them , but an M_incorrigible L_propensity to M_choose the L_wrong L_ones and an L_awesome L_efficiency in L_achieving them unless L_adults L_intervene ."
ecv-fragment05,1150,"All in all , it is a L_pretty L_unconvincing M_picture ."
ecv-fragment05,1151,"If you M_say that L_children are L_completely L_non-rational then you have to L_account for the L_fact that they L_become L_rational , and to do that it L_appears from these L_examples that you have to L_assume that they L_already are ."
ecv-fragment05,1152,"If , on the other M_hand , you M_allow L_rationality to L_children , then you can not L_use their L_lack of it as a L_criterion to M_distinguish them from L_adults ."

ecv-fragment05,1154,"are not L_aware of the L_unreality of their L_original M_pictures which is why , L_often in the same L_sentence , they M_produce these L_contradictions ."
ecv-fragment05,1155,The one M_thing they do not do is to L_re-examine the M_original for the L_tell-tale M_signs of M_forgery .
ecv-fragment05,1156,L_ILLEGITIMATE L_INFERENCES
ecv-fragment05,1157,"The M_recognition that L_children can not L_simply be M_written off in the L_rationality M_stakes and can not L_therefore be L_denied M_autonomy on this M_account has M_led some L_writers to L_conclude that they can not , L_therefore , be L_denied it on any M_account ."
ecv-fragment05,1158,"We should M_notice that this M_view is not just a M_flight of L_fancy from the L_loony L_left , the L_pederast L_lobby or L_children themselves ."
ecv-fragment05,1159,It is L_also to be M_found in M_stronger or M_weaker M_versions of more L_cautious L_academic L_thought .
ecv-fragment05,1160,"In L_Escape from L_Childhood ( 1974 ) , L_John L_Holt M_notes that L_children are , in L_fact , L_capable of a L_great L_deal more than L_modern L_society M_allows them to be ."
ecv-fragment05,1161,"He M_sees L_childhood as a L_fairly L_modern M_invention M_designed to M_fit L_adult L_rather than L_children 's L_needs , and an L_oppressive M_invention at that ."
ecv-fragment05,1162,"He L_suggests that L_children should be M_given a L_comprehensive M_range of L_civil and L_legal L_rights L_including the L_right to L_vote , to L_manage their own L_financial L_affairs , to M_direct and L_manage their own L_education and to M_control their own L_sex L_lives and"
ecv-fragment05,1163,"to M_make and M_enter into , on a L_basis of L_mutual L_consent , L_quasifamilial L_relationships outside L_one 's M_immediate L_family — i.e. the L_right to L_seek and L_choose L_guardians other than one 's own L_parents and to be L_legally L_dependent on them ."
ecv-fragment05,1164,"( L_Holt , 1974 , p. 16 )"
ecv-fragment05,1165,"This is L_also the M_view L_put L_forward by L_John L_Harris , though in L_less L_specific L_terms ."
ecv-fragment05,1166,"Like L_Holt , L_Harris L_believes that the L_so-called L_incompetence of L_children is an L_adult M_invention L_imposed on L_children for L_adults ' L_convenience ."
ecv-fragment05,1167,"He M_makes a M_firm L_proposal that the L_age of L_majority should be L_gradually M_reduced to 10 L_years , and L_remarks :"
ecv-fragment05,1168,"We must L_remember that to L_deny L_someone M_control of their own L_lives is to L_offer them a most L_profound L_insult , not to L_mention the which the L_frustration of their L_wishes and the M_setting at M_naught of their own L_plans for themselves will M_add ."
ecv-fragment05,1169,L_Perhaps we should M_conduct L_annual L_examinations from an L_early L_age to be L_sure that we do as L_little of this L_sort of M_damage as L_possible ?
ecv-fragment05,1170,"( L_Harris , 1982 , p. 49 )"
ecv-fragment05,1171,"Now L_Holt and L_Harris both have L_many M_wise , M_enlightened and M_humane M_observations to M_make about some of the L_injustices which we L_inflict upon L_children , but as these L_remarks M_show , M_putting them L_right without L_inflicting L_equally L_grave L_injustice is no L_easy L_matter ."
ecv-fragment05,1172,"Both of them L_appear to M_suffer from a M_form of L_mental M_myopia in L_imagining the L_consequences of such L_proposals , and I am not here M_referring only to L_Mill-type L_consequences of L_harm L_brought about by L_unwise L_decisions ."
ecv-fragment05,1173,"What , we may L_ask L_Holt , L_happens to the L_child who , L_dissatisfied at L_home , L_seeks in L_vain for L_guardians who would M_suit him ?"
ecv-fragment05,1174,What if no L_one L_wants him ?
ecv-fragment05,1175,Our L_papers are L_currently M_full of ‘ M_hard-to-place ’ L_children in L_local L_authority L_care L_advertising for L_foster or L_adoptive L_parents .
ecv-fragment05,1176,In such a M_situation the L_skilled L_care of L_social L_workers is L_crucial to L_ensuring that an L_unwanted M_by-product of L_success for some L_children is not the L_total M_destruction of L_self-esteem for L_others .
ecv-fragment05,1177,"What , we may L_ask L_Harris , L_happens to the L_child who L_repeatedly L_fails his L_annual L_examination ?"
ecv-fragment05,1178,"To L_impose such a L_test on L_children would be a L_particularly L_invidious M_way of L_discriminating against them , unless L_Harris has in L_mind that we should all L_undergo such L_examination ."
ecv-fragment05,1179,He might then be M_open to M_bitter L_objections from L_many L_adults .
ecv-fragment05,1180,"These two L_suggestions , M_far from being L_enlightened M_liberation of all L_children , are L_actually L_oppression of a M_deeply M_damaging L_kind to at L_least some , and L_Harris 's L_suggestion M_contains a M_capacity L_criterion in M_disguise ."
ecv-fragment05,1181,"In any L_case , it would be L_dishonest to L_pretend that L_Mill-type L_consequences are not L_relevant here ."
ecv-fragment05,1182,L_Suppose L_Holt 's 6-year-old does L_opt out of L_school ?
ecv-fragment05,1183,What L_happens to her then ?
ecv-fragment05,1184,What L_happens if her L_father is L_unwilling or L_unable to L_stay at L_home with her ?
ecv-fragment05,1185,Is it any L_better to L_oblige her to L_go L_abseiling or L_butterfly-catching L_instead ?
ecv-fragment05,1186,"L_However L_much she may L_enjoy such L_pursuits , there will be L_times when she would L_actually L_rather L_wander the L_streets L_unaccompanied ."
ecv-fragment05,1187,"L_Given that L_Holt is L_presumably not L_volunteering himself to M_take L_care of her , who will ?"
ecv-fragment05,1188,His M_view that L_letting L_children L_run in and out of L_busy L_airports L_smartly L_avoiding the L_traffic is L_perfectly L_reasonable L_depends upon a M_conception of a L_child which is M_far M_narrower than L_even the L_sex L_divide .
ecv-fragment05,1189,"L_Holt 's L_child is L_actually the M_Artful M_Dodger ; L_mercifully , not all L_children are ."
ecv-fragment05,1190,There are other L_difficulties too .
ecv-fragment05,1191,"It is not M_clear whether or not L_Harris L_thinks that L_children of 10 should be L_obliged to L_take on M_full L_political L_status whether or not they L_want to , but L_Holt L_clearly does not ."
ecv-fragment05,1192,"He L_proposes that ‘ the L_rights , L_privileges , L_duties , L_responsibilities of L_adult L_citizens be M_made L_available to any L_young L_person , of whatever L_age , who L_wants to M_make L_use of them ’ ( L_Holt , 1974 , p. 15 ) ."
ecv-fragment05,1193,"If L_Holt L_thinks that this L_proposal would M_remove an L_arbitrary M_boundary M_line between L_adults and L_children , then he is L_mistaken ."
ecv-fragment05,1194,"The M_point about an L_adult L_citizen is that he has these L_rights , L_privileges , L_duties and L_responsibilities whether or not he L_wants them ."
ecv-fragment05,1195,"He may not M_exercise his L_rights or he may L_shirk his L_duties , but he can not L_forgo them ."
ecv-fragment05,1196,"They are not just L_available to him , they are his ."
ecv-fragment05,1197,That is what being a L_citizen M_involves .
ecv-fragment05,1198,L_Rights and L_privileges do not L_pose any L_particular L_problems in the L_case of L_children .
ecv-fragment05,1199,"L_Holt can and does L_believe that L_children should have them as L_adults do , and then M_leaves it up to the L_child to L_decide whether or not to M_exercise them ."
ecv-fragment05,1200,But the same can not be M_said for L_duties and L_responsibilities .
ecv-fragment05,1201,L_Failure to M_exercise one 's L_rights may be L_morally L_neutral ; L_failure to L_carry out one 's L_duties is not .
ecv-fragment05,1202,"It would be L_perfectly L_possible to M_give the L_rights to L_children without L_imposing the L_duties on them , the L_one does not M_entail the other , but we would then L_still be M_distinguishing between L_adults and L_children as L_citizens ."
ecv-fragment05,1203,L_Children L_still would not have M_full L_political L_status .
ecv-fragment05,1204,L_Duties and L_responsibilities are not L_merely L_available to a L_citizen ; they are an M_integral M_part of being a L_citizen .
ecv-fragment05,1205,L_Holt does not L_want L_children to be L_obliged to L_take on any of these L_responsibilities and he M_manages to M_make his M_point by M_concentrating L_solely on the L_rights so that he can L_remark :
ecv-fragment05,1206,"I do not M_say , L_either , that these L_rights and L_duties should be M_tied into one M_package , that if a L_young L_person L_wants to L_assume any of them , he must L_assume them all ."
ecv-fragment05,1207,He should be L_able to M_pick and L_choose .
ecv-fragment05,1208,"( L_Holt , 1974 , p. 16 )"
ecv-fragment05,1209,"If he can ‘ M_pick and L_choose ’ , I L_suggest , he is not a L_citizen , he does not have M_full L_political L_status and he is L_quite M_distinguishable on these M_grounds L_alone from the L_adults around him who do not have this L_option ."
ecv-fragment05,1210,"L_Holt and L_Harris both , in the M_end , M_face the same L_problem ."
ecv-fragment05,1211,"They M_attack the L_status L_quo by M_pointing out that the L_reasons M_given for L_denying L_rights to L_children are L_bad L_reasons , and then L_explicitly or L_implicitly L_deny them L_duties for no L_reason at all ."
ecv-fragment05,1212,"Whatever L_else such a L_strategy may M_achieve , it L_certainly does not M_manage to M_produce a M_situation in which L_children are L_politically M_indistinguishable from L_adults and it M_rests on M_premises which , unless they can be M_defended , M_gain L_nothing for any M_defence to the M_charge of L_arbitrariness ."
ecv-fragment05,1213,"WHEN IN L_DOUBT , M_GO M_BACK TO L_ARISTOTLE"
ecv-fragment05,1214,The L_trouble with all the M_views which we have M_looked at is that they M_tie the L_notion of M_autonomy M_firmly and L_solely to that of L_knowledge M_interpreted in either a M_broad or M_narrow M_sense .
ecv-fragment05,1215,That it is M_firmly M_tied must be L_correct ; the L_inhabitants of M_Brave M_New M_World are not M_autonomous L_precisely because they are L_denied M_access to L_relevant L_information .
ecv-fragment05,1216,L_Relevant L_knowledge is a L_precondition of M_autonomy but it is not M_synonymous with it .
ecv-fragment05,1217,L_Aristotle M_said L_something very L_interesting in that M_extract from the L_Politics which I L_quoted L_earlier ; he M_said that L_women have a L_deliberative L_faculty but that it L_lacks M_full M_authority .

kbh-fragment04,317,You were in your L_cradle .
kbh-fragment04,318,"L_Elvis , did n't he ?"
kbh-fragment04,319,"I do n't L_think he L_ever L_recorded it , I L_think he just L_used to L_sing it at his , er L_sort of L_cabaret ."
kbh-fragment04,320,"L_Well so L_many of these L_songs have been done by so L_many L_people that you would be L_forgiven for L_thinking that , that ."
kbh-fragment04,321,"Because there 's L_one there , one on one of these that er either L_Paul L_Simon or L_Art L_Garfunkel or L_someone , ca n't L_remember which one , L_probably L_Art L_Garfunkel as L_Paul L_Simon does all his own does n't he ?"
kbh-fragment04,322,L_Well he has done other L_people 's .
kbh-fragment04,323,"L_Well there 's one on there , I ca n't L_remember"
kbh-fragment04,324,"Like for L_instance the , L_er , what do they L_call those two ?"
kbh-fragment04,325,Oh the two L_brothers .
kbh-fragment04,326,In the
kbh-fragment04,327,L_Everley L_Brothers ?
kbh-fragment04,328,"The L_Everley L_Brothers , that 's it ."
kbh-fragment04,329,"You L_know , L_Wake up L_Little L_Suzie ?"
kbh-fragment04,330,Oh L_yeah .

kbh-fragment04,332,M_Wicked L_far out .
kbh-fragment04,333,it 's a L_groovy L_record this .
kbh-fragment04,334,L_Shut up .
kbh-fragment04,335,Ca n't L_remember which one it is but I 'll L_recognise it when I L_hear it .
kbh-fragment04,336,"He 's doing very L_well , is n't he ."
kbh-fragment04,337,He is .
kbh-fragment04,338,Have to L_employ him L_full L_time .
kbh-fragment04,339,He 's L_always L_quite L_good .
kbh-fragment04,340,I just ca n't L_believe how L_daft he is .
kbh-fragment04,341,I L_suppose you like that L_film .
kbh-fragment04,342,Yes .
kbh-fragment04,343,L_Forget it .
kbh-fragment04,344,You 're not having L_cake .
kbh-fragment04,345,Does she like L_cake ?
kbh-fragment04,346,L_Well she 's L_looking at it .
kbh-fragment04,347,So how 's M_things down at the ?
kbh-fragment04,348,Not too L_bad .
kbh-fragment04,349,L_Quite L_good L_actually .
kbh-fragment04,350,Yeah ?
kbh-fragment04,351,L_Keeping him L_busy out on L_estimates and
kbh-fragment04,352,Yeah he 's out all this L_week .
kbh-fragment04,353,"L_Well , my L_dad wo n't M_pass them onto L_Terry ."
kbh-fragment04,354,"Me L_dad L_said he 's had L_enough L_Well , we were L_debating whether to M_give it to you or not ."
kbh-fragment04,355,"But I L_thought , L_well if L_Terry L_notices he might ."
kbh-fragment04,356,L_Well in L_fact two L_really M_big L_estimates
kbh-fragment04,357,"Who , L_Terry ?"
kbh-fragment04,358,Yeah .
kbh-fragment04,359,"And one M_wanted L_re-estimating , the other one M_wanted a few more L_prices L_cos L_everything like L_marble L_tops which are L_going to L_cost a L_fortune to L_get done ."
kbh-fragment04,360,We M_give them a L_provisional L_kind of L_price and not L_really M_gone into it in M_detail .
kbh-fragment04,361,So she had a L_list of about five M_things she L_wanted M_sorted out and she L_said so M_far we were the L_cheapest .
kbh-fragment04,362,But she 's M_got about six L_different L_firms on the L_computer and was L_comparing L_notes .
kbh-fragment04,363,So I L_worked out and the other two were L_really L_fitting and L_electrics and it was all down to L_Terry to M_sort those out .
kbh-fragment04,364,"And they 're both , about two to three thousand L_pounds L_worth of L_sanitary L_ware or more but two to three thousand L_pounds L_worth of L_work ."
kbh-fragment04,365,"L_Well you ca n't L_afford to M_lose them , can you ?"
kbh-fragment04,366,No .
kbh-fragment04,367,So what 's L_going to L_happen then ?
kbh-fragment04,368,L_God L_knows .
kbh-fragment04,369,"He L_said , I L_asked , L_asked , L_well I L_left a L_message on L_Saturday for him to M_sort them out did n't I ?"
kbh-fragment04,370,He L_already L_knew about that .
kbh-fragment04,371,"And then I L_asked my L_father on L_Tuesday to L_remind him and he L_said , he 'd L_already L_said he 'd M_fetch them in on L_Tuesday ."
kbh-fragment04,372,"And he , my L_father L_reminded him L_last L_night and he L_said L_yeah he would have them by L_tomorrow L_morning ."
kbh-fragment04,373,"But he 's , he just L_really has to L_get in L_touch with one of them and L_tell them the L_prices ."
kbh-fragment04,374,So I do n't L_know .
kbh-fragment04,375,"L_Well , I L_mean he 'd done , he 's done this L_first L_estimate , these are all just M_polishing M_touches L_cos L_people are L_obviously L_interested in , you L_know they 're L_well M_keen on our L_prices ."
kbh-fragment04,376,they ca n't M_pursue it till we L_come L_back to them .
kbh-fragment04,377,They 're not M_pursuing it until we M_put these M_things out .
kbh-fragment04,378,My L_father just L_turned L_round I 've had L_enough of it if L_Terry 's not L_going to do the L_estimate he M_passes them on to L_Brian .
kbh-fragment04,379,I L_said L_yeah then I M_get into L_trouble with them for not M_passing L_estimates to L_Terry and then there 's an L_argument .
kbh-fragment04,380,"If he , if he L_says L_anything to me I 'll just have to L_tell him ."
kbh-fragment04,381,But he 's not doing the L_estimates he 's been M_given and he ca n't L_afford to M_throw L_money M_away .
kbh-fragment04,382,It 's L_cos he 's L_working for him at the L_moment L_money .
kbh-fragment04,383,He L_always L_gets like that and then he L_forgets after like a L_month or two when he has n't L_worked for him .
kbh-fragment04,384,He L_forgets how L_annoying he can be and you L_know he M_swings the other M_way .
kbh-fragment04,385,I L_mean L_Brian 's L_pulled in a M_lot of L_work .
kbh-fragment04,386,"M_lot of L_people L_kind of L_saying L_come L_back again on L_Thursday So he 's , he 's ."
kbh-fragment04,387,If we M_got L_Terry to do that we 'd be L_well M_away .
kbh-fragment04,388,"They , they would L_love him I L_mean one of them it was L_annoying L_really L_cos L_Terry 's just not M_pulling his M_weight ."
kbh-fragment04,389,"I do n't L_understand it , if I L_live to be a hundred I wo n't L_understand it ."
kbh-fragment04,390,"And L_also , it 's L_cos that , you L_know after we had that L_row about L_Terry , after L_Bank L_Holiday L_expecting not to have to do a L_day in the L_shop , and er he 's L_already L_owing L_Brian a L_day ?"
kbh-fragment04,391,L_Guess who 's doing the L_extra L_day ? M_got my L_dad to M_cover a L_day .
kbh-fragment04,392,And then he M_takes a L_day off L_Bank L_Holidays .
kbh-fragment04,393,and he ca n't do it because my L_dad .
kbh-fragment04,394,But then L_tomorrow he 's L_actually doing his own L_work .
kbh-fragment04,395,So he could L_easily have .
kbh-fragment04,396,And on L_Monday
kbh-fragment04,397,So who 's M_covering L_tomorrow ?
kbh-fragment04,398,L_Well my L_brother 's M_covered L_practically all L_week and L_Brian 's doing L_tomorrow .
kbh-fragment04,399,"L_Terry L_phoned up L_asking what , L_Tuesday L_morning about L_quarter past eight L_said who was M_covering ."
kbh-fragment04,400,And he L_said L_well my L_father is doing L_today I ca n't do L_today I 'll do it L_Friday and I L_shouted down the L_stairs but he L_owes you a L_day you should n't be L_going in .
kbh-fragment04,401,I L_mean he has n't been in the L_shop once this L_week .
kbh-fragment04,402,L_Somebody 's L_got to L_tell him to
kbh-fragment04,403,So do L_Dave and L_Terry in the L_shop .
kbh-fragment04,404,They have the L_records .
kbh-fragment04,405,And it has n't been M_sorted L_yet ?
kbh-fragment04,406,Oh no .
kbh-fragment04,407,"He 's M_got the M_gall to L_phone up on L_Tuesday and L_say L_Eileen ca n't do a L_day , we 're L_going to be M_short of L_Eileen ."
kbh-fragment04,408,So the M_answer is to just L_phone them .
kbh-fragment04,409,I ca n't do it .
kbh-fragment04,410,I 'm not doing it .
kbh-fragment04,411,What 's the M_point of L_carrying on like that ?
kbh-fragment04,412,L_Well he 's L_going to L_carry on like that is n't he ?
kbh-fragment04,413,Not unless L_someone M_puts their M_foot down .
kbh-fragment04,414,And if your L_father is L_currently M_taking your M_side of M_things M_worth L_sounding him out as to how M_far he 'll M_take
kbh-fragment04,415,L_Ah
kbh-fragment04,416,whilst he 's in the L_mood ?
kbh-fragment04,417,Yeah .
kbh-fragment04,418,He 's not being that L_much
kbh-fragment04,419,You L_sure ?
kbh-fragment04,420,L_Mmm .
kbh-fragment04,421,He 's L_probably only in the L_mood L_cos he 's L_probably M_upsetting them on his L_night out L_cos they L_go out in the L_evenings .
kbh-fragment04,422,"On a L_Wednesday L_evening , do n't they ."
kbh-fragment04,423,L_Cos L_Terry
kbh-fragment04,424,"I L_mean , would n't he L_rather have L_Terry as a L_sort of L_permanent L_worker L_anyway ?"
kbh-fragment04,425,It 's not being M_fair
kbh-fragment04,426,do any L_work .
kbh-fragment04,427,"Oh what , your L_dad ?"
kbh-fragment04,428,L_Pauline 's L_dad L_er
kbh-fragment04,429,too L_expensive I L_think .
kbh-fragment04,430,"L_Terry L_uses the L_shop to L_get L_extra L_money every so L_often , L_uses my L_dad L_ticking over L_running when he"
kbh-fragment04,431,Why .
kbh-fragment04,432,"He does M_get the L_offer , I L_mean"
kbh-fragment04,433,two L_months and she L_phoned up and I L_kind of M_made out it L_got L_lost in the L_post .
kbh-fragment04,434,"I L_erm L_got , L_check you 've M_got two L_days , you 've L_got M_give me the L_estimate , it 's L_got to be on because she 's L_expecting it to be done L_straight L_away on the L_computer and L_sent ."
kbh-fragment04,435,And he L_actually L_got that one done .
kbh-fragment04,436,Do you L_know it was only five M_lines .
kbh-fragment04,437,I L_mean I could have M_made it up it was that L_easy .
kbh-fragment04,438,So I L_sent that off .
kbh-fragment04,439,"She was in L_first M_thing , I L_mean I L_sent it off that L_evening she was in L_first M_thing the M_next L_morning L_yes that 's M_fine ."
kbh-fragment04,440,So he 's M_got that L_job and another one .
kbh-fragment04,441,She 's L_trying is n't she ?
kbh-fragment04,442,"I do n't L_understand why it L_surprises you , that 's what M_gets me ."
kbh-fragment04,443,I L_mean
kbh-fragment04,444,It 's L_normal L_behaviour .
kbh-fragment04,445,L_Charlotte 's done it too .
kbh-fragment04,446,"Can you L_pass me that L_er , M_sheet ?"
kbh-fragment04,447,This ?
kbh-fragment04,448,Is that your L_reading ?
kbh-fragment04,449,That 's not your L_regulations you have to L_read is it ?
kbh-fragment04,450,"Oh no , that 's a"
kbh-fragment04,451,I was L_going to L_say that does n't L_seem very L_thick
kbh-fragment04,452,"No , that 's to do with this L_tape ."
kbh-fragment04,453,"Oh I L_tell you what is L_quite L_funny these , the L_act ."
kbh-fragment04,454,L_Mmm .
kbh-fragment04,455,Oh .
kbh-fragment04,456,"L_hereby L_enacted her L_gracious L_majesty , you L_know , etcetera etcetera ."
kbh-fragment04,457,"What was it , the L_Lords L_temporal and L_spiritual , that 's what they L_call themselves ."
kbh-fragment04,458,"Now that is , that 's"
kbh-fragment04,459,Yes .
kbh-fragment04,460,Yeah I L_realise and I L_hope I do n't M_come into M_contact with too L_many L_acts of L_parliament .
kbh-fragment04,461,"Oh , we had L_someone L_round to L_see the L_house L_yesterday ."
kbh-fragment04,462,Oh L_yeah ?
kbh-fragment04,463,"They L_came twenty L_minutes L_early , there 's L_Brian up in the L_shower , there 's me L_stuffing L_things in the L_cupboard under the L_stairs ."
kbh-fragment04,464,That 's an M_old M_trick .
kbh-fragment04,465,"I L_said to L_Danny , do n't L_open the L_door ."
kbh-fragment04,466,Do n't L_open the L_door !
kbh-fragment04,467,"So as I 'm L_still L_trying to L_stuff L_things L_away , she L_opened the L_door and L_everything L_fell out ."
kbh-fragment04,468,"L_look L_round the L_front L_room , then they L_looked L_round the , the L_garden ."
kbh-fragment04,469,While they were L_looking L_round the L_garden I you 've L_got to L_get out the L_shower L_quick .
kbh-fragment04,470,I do n't L_know .
kbh-fragment04,471,"They 'd M_come down from , they 'd M_come down from , L_erm , L_somewhere or other ."
kbh-fragment04,472,They 're just doing a L_kind of L_tour of M_loads and M_loads of L_houses L_cos they L_keep L_moving with his L_job .
kbh-fragment04,473,"Oh , L_right ."
kbh-fragment04,474,"She L_quite , I L_think she L_liked the L_area , she was L_saying about the L_schools and that ."
kbh-fragment04,475,"L_Mind you , she L_likes L_erm and they 're all L_separate , all the L_best L_ones L_round here are ."
kbh-fragment04,476,She L_said do n't they have any M_details ?
kbh-fragment04,477,"So I L_said L_well , no it 's not now is it , it 's L_erm , oh it 's that L_school that the ."
kbh-fragment04,478,L_Something and L_School of L_Arts now it 's L_called L_well L_technical
kbh-fragment04,479,L_School of L_Arts L_round here ?
kbh-fragment04,480,"No it 's another , L_well L_technical ,"
kbh-fragment04,481,L_performing L_arts here .
kbh-fragment04,482,L_performing L_arts and that 's the L_technical
kbh-fragment04,483,It 's a L_monstrosity .
kbh-fragment04,484,"Oh you M_rotten M_old M_pig , you 've been L_sick ."
kbh-fragment04,485,Oh she has n't ?
kbh-fragment04,486,Oh .
kbh-fragment04,487,"Yeah , it 's L_alright ."
kbh-fragment04,488,is it L_washable ?
kbh-fragment04,489,"Yeah , I L_think so ."
kbh-fragment04,490,You 'll L_soon L_find out .
kbh-fragment04,491,Yes .
kbh-fragment04,492,Do you M_feel L_better now ?
kbh-fragment04,493,L_Obviously .

kbw-fragment09,3754,"It was when you were L_playing with it with your L_fingers , do you L_remember ?"
kbw-fragment09,3755,L_Anyway it wo n't L_matter .
